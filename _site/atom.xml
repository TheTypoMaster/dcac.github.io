    <title>The Value of a Veteran Filmmaker</title>

    <id>/content/2015/7/22/the-value-of-a-veteran-filmmaker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It is interesting, and a little alarming, that so many sophomore directors are being handed projects with potentially studio-destroying budgets. Marc Webb with the Andrew Garfield <em>Spider-Man</em>, Colin Trevorrow with <em>Jurassic World</em>, Josh Trank with <em>Fantastic Four</em>  (and, until recently, an iteration of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise). Last year it was Gareth Edwards with <em>Godzilla</em>, this year it is Jon Watts and the Spider-Man reboot—Watts is, incidentally, a director whose first feature <em>hasn’t</em> <em>actually been</em> <em>in wide release</em> _yet. </p>

<p>While directing seems to be one of those professions that is only perfected through doing, what doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense is the immediate jump from zero funded indie to budgets that are the GNP’s of some countries. When even someone as savvy and experienced as Joss Whedon (although <em>The Avengers</em> really was just his second feature film) can be turned out because of the kind of terrible shearing pressure that these films can generate, it seems a awful lot to expect first-or-second timers to negotiate. Josh Trank, whose indie <em>Chronicle</em> (12 million dollar budget) led directly to <em>The</em> <em>Fantastic</em> <em>Four</em> (budget 122 million) just recently lost the <em>Star Wars</em> gig, at least partially, because of erratic behavior on the set of <em>FF.</em> </p>

<p>If it were only a question of money, or even logistics, perhaps a lack of practical experience would be less of an issue, but the pressures involved in these sorts of enterprises come from every angle imaginable. Anyone without a fair amount of experience, both as a director and just as a human, is likely to be pulled apart. (For an example of how badly this can go I would point everyone to the documentary <em>Overnight.</em> Troy Duffy was the writer/director of <em>Boondock Saints</em> and is the poster boy for the worst-case scenario in this instance.)</p>

<p>These budgets not only represent a huge investment on the part of the studio but they also come with any number of peripheral expectations: to serve the fan base, to meet unrealistic first weekend goals, to manage the inevitable, and often contradictory, demands that come with promotional budgets that often are as large as the production budgets. Sometimes these films even represent investments significant enough to topple whole studio—forget what a flop might do to the individuals involved. There are probably very few twenty-six year olds equipped to manage any one of these concerns, much less all of them.</p>

<p>Less important whether any particular film works, though, is what this approach may be doing to a whole generation of up and coming filmmakers. Not so long ago it was possible to build a body of work that allowed for a gradual maturing of the creative process. Directors like Scorsese, Cuarón, The Coen Bros., Kathryn Bigelow or even Guillermo Del Toro were initially involved in low budget, low stakes (at least in a fiscal sense) filmmaking. Films like <em>Mean Streets, , Near Dark, Sólo Con Tu Pareja, El Espinazo del Diablo, Blood Simple,</em> were, most importantly, all steps along a longer creative path and not just an audition for a place at the summer tentpole trough.</p>

<p>What that meant was the filmmakers in question could afford a mistake or two and it wouldn’t cost the studio millions of dollars, people their careers or even risk ending up being the punch line in a terrible joke. Q: What cost 200 million dollars and has four arms. A: <em>John Carter.</em> And let’s face it, you don’t hear Andrew Stanton being bandied about as the next big thing—but this was a guy, just three years ago, who was being touted as another Brad Bird.</p>

<p>Probably the best example I can give of the potential cost of all of this is not the most obvious one. If you compare <em>Jurassic World</em> to <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> (at least in the most reductive way possible) you might say one was a moderate success while the other was an unprecedented accomplishment. But if you watch all the interviews and other media that led up to both releases, only one of the two directors looked like they had just finished crossing the ocean in an open boat,while fighting off sharks the whole way. And it wasn’t the seventy year-old who had spent six months in the desert with a pissed off Tom Hardy.</p>

<p>Colin Trevorrow looks and sounds like he has a bad case of PTSD, and implicit in almost all his interviews is a kind of weariness that seems almost tragic. This is person whose first film, <em>Safety Not Guaranteed,</em> was a charming, low budget indie. His next film was <em>Jurassic World</em>, now one of the highest grossing films ever made. Trevorrow himself lamented his fate, in an article from Indiewire on July 7th  2015 <strong>“[Spielberg] had the privilege of being able to make a long series of original films—‘Sugarland Express,’ ‘Duel,’ and then ‘Jaws’—and from there, built up to something the size of [the ‘Jurassic Park’ franchise]. And in a certain way, I felt like I was being robbed of that right of a filmmaker to make a bunch of mistakes and learn from those mistakes.”</strong></p>

<p>Of course most directors will jump at the chance to helm one of these films. People who choose that profession often personify the term hubris (although notably, Ava DuVernay has turned down <em>Black Panther</em>, specifically citing her desire to continue developing her own voice—so it is not always the case). Certainly it is ridiculous to expect the studios not to continue along this path as long as the success rate is over a certain percentage.</p>

<p>Perhaps the question is this: what is the cost of our collective, and seemingly never ending, desire for more and bigger and faster? There is a huge amount of social media pressure being exerted on the studios to produce whole slews of the kind of shared world films that the Marvel and DC universes represent. Perhaps in our desire to see these films created we have lost sight of some of the costs involved. </p>

<p>It is worth wondering, at least, what these individuals might have done were they not so quickly subsumed into the machine, if they had to eke out their own path in the wilderness for a little while longer. </p>

<p>After all, can you really have a <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> without first having taken the long trip Beyond Thunderdome?</p>

    <id>/content/2015/7/20/trainwreck</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Thank you for taking a chance. </p>

<p><em>Trainwreck</em> is a rom-com that turns the genre on its head. But it’s still about as rom-commy as a rom-com can get. And that’s okay, because this movie isn’t <em>just</em> a rom-com (I enjoy saying ‘rom-com’), it’s a stance. A stance in the face of Hollywood. It says that we are willing and ready to invest in a film with two leads that weren’t manufactured in the gorgeous celebrity factory. </p>

<p>Amy Schumer plays an anti-commitment, single woman living in New York. She’s self-aware; she realizes that she doesn’t need to be a size 0 to be sexy (despite what studio <a href="http://www.takepart.com/video/2015/03/09/amy-schumer-asked-to-starve-for-trainwreck">execs</a> had to say). She’s confident in her interactions with men, until she meets Aaron, an up and coming sports doctor who is persistent in his pursuit.</p>

<p>When Amy Schumer developed the script for <em>Trainwreck</em>, she was expecting a plastic princess to take the lead, but to her surprise, the Hollywood big wigs wanted her as the titular character. This is where you could have come in and decided to cast a Matt Bomer or Charlie Hunnam to play her love interest. I’m so happy that you didn’t. You went with Bill Hader, a man best known for mimicking a tauntaun and playing a metrosexual travel expert with a fetish for fetish clubs. </p>

<p>How refreshing!</p>

<p>Amy Schumer has made a living by being a normal human being and pointing out how horrible the media is—but casting an “average” girl isn’t anything new in Tinseltown. They’ve been slapping ponytails and fake glasses on hot women for years. No, the real risk you took was also adding Bill Hader to the mix. This is the first time in his career that he’s been cast as a love interest. </p>

<p>Your against-the-norm casting is part of what makes <em>Trainwreck</em> so enjoyable. The film is jam-packed with celebrity cameos (Daniel Radcliffe, Amar’e Stoudemire, Lebron James), any number of whom are considered sex symbols, but they were all fillers. The real attraction is between the slightly awkward, pizza-loving Amy Schumer and the stiff, nerdy Bill Hader. </p>

<p>Kudos on your peculiar but successful casting of Lebron James as the penny-pinching, emotional best friend and John Cena as the sensitive, closeted homosexual. Choosing athletes in the prime of their career and having them do a complete 180 was not only a pleasant surprise, but also a key element in making <em>Trainwreck</em> hilarious.</p>

<p>Given the <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/7/4/terminator-genysis.html">importance</a> of proper casting in highly anticipated movies, your strategic mixing and matching enhances the overall experience and ensures <em>Trainwreck</em> will be a sought after addition to the W network’s primetime slot for years to come.</p>

<p>With Bill Hader and Amy Schumer hogging the spotlight in this movie -- and Ike Barinholtz appearing as the love interest to Amy Poehler in the upcoming comedy, <em>Sisters</em> -- our traditional rom-com heavyweights might soon be out of a job. Can anyone spare a dime for a smoulder?</p>

<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

<p>Ankit</p>

    <title>Big Game</title>

    <id>/content/2015/7/16/big-game</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I didn’t like your movie <em>Big Game</em> very much, but my real argument with you is less about the quality of your particular film and more to do with a larger issue.</p>

<p>First though, here’s why I didn’t enjoy <em>Big Game</em> specifically. The film is poorly written, unimaginatively shot, the performances are flat and uninteresting, and while you got Sam Jackson for the lead, Kyle MacLachlan could have easily replaced him and no one would have noticed, the part was so one dimensional. Still, much of that can be forgiven if the film is innovative or even just energetic, but <em>Big Game</em> is the worst of all possible things an action movie can be—it is irredeemably dull. My god, it is dull. Like sitting-on-the-bus-head–nodding-wondering–if- you-were-drooling-dull.</p>

<p>My real complaint has to do with something less concrete, but perhaps in the long run more important. While it is impossible, or maybe just pointless, to try and make qualitative distinctions about capital A art—is Picasso’s <em>Guernica</em> in some way better than Da Vinci’s <em>Mona Lisa</em>—it is entirely possible to make those kind of distinctions about entertainments. Every artist may be a thief, but if you are stealing sub standard material to begin with then the whole project can’t help but suck. It is here that I really have a bone to pick with you. </p>

<p>I have a hard time understanding why some people fetishize certain films from certain eras. There is, in particular, a tendency to point to the late eighties and into the nineties as some golden age for action films. Films like John McTiernan’s <em>Die Hard</em> (1988) or his <em>Predator</em> (1987) are just two examples that people often talk about in bafflingly reverent terms. In your case it is hard not to cite Wolfgang Peterson’s <em>Air Force One or 1993’s _The Fugitive as obviously carrying some weight with you, since these films so clearly influence _Big Game.</em></p>

<p>All of these were just fine as straightforward entertainments, fun to watch, kitschy in a good way, but for the most part they suffer in comparison to the best stuff being made now. There is a simple reason for that. Since they were hardly transcendent entertainments at the time, they will always suffer with age. They won’t look as good, the stunts aren’t as impressive, the camera work is constrained by technical concerns and the filmmaker’s imagination is circumscribed by what it is possible to actually show onscreen. </p>

<p>While the very best entertainments seem visually timeless (<em>Blade Runner</em> is perhaps the best example of that truth) they were, and still remain, superior in terms of performance, themes and creative execution—the imagination informing the story makes it onto the screen. So regardless of the advances in the technical aspects of filmmaking—CGI, smaller cameras, better and more dangerous stunt work—films like <em>Alien</em> and <em>Raider’s of The Lost Ark</em> still stand head and shoulders above most. This is because the more abstract facets of the craft—performance, direction, art direction, storytelling, editing—don’t suffer as much with age.</p>

<p>But when you set out to make a b-film, a straight up actioner without any pretensions, I can’t imagine why you would go the way you did, Jalmari. Instead of taking advantage of all the latest technical innovations and possibilities inherent in them, you went the other way. Instead of <em>The Raid: Redemption</em> you made some pale echo of <em>Patriot Games</em>. </p>

<p>Here is my entirely unsolicited advice. Don’t waste your budget on Sam Jackson if you aren’t going to use him properly. Instead, invest in some go-pro’s and some stunt work and make use of that unbelievable Finnish landscape. Tell me a mildly interesting story instead of this stupid, derivative crap that parrots stuff that wasn’t that good in the first place.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/7/8/a-conversation-with-director-jalmari-helander</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Finnish director Jalmari Helander is breaking into the Hollywood game with a new actioner starring Samuel Jackson – <em>Big Game</em>. We talk about his breakout success film <em>Rare Exports</em>, what’s wrong with most action movies today, and who he wants to make the next big action star. </p>

<p><strong>Let’s start by talking about <em>Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010)</em>. The movie quickly became a cult classic, at least here in Canada. What was your goal in creating that film?</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t have any kinds of goals. I tried to survive the whole thing and get the movie done. That was my goal. I also had a goal to make a different kind of Finnish movie, because in Finland all the movies are really boring, and I wanted to do something else and I’m really glad it worked out.</p>

<p><strong>What were some of the things you learned when you were making that movie?</strong> </p>

<p>Well of course I learned quite a lot. It was my first feature film. I have to say that the biggest lesson I learned was that if something doesn’t work in the script it will not work when we’re shooting it, and it will give you nightmares. You have to solve that problem when you are writing, it’s not going to solve itself later on. That’s my biggest lesson ever.</p>

<p><strong>Were there things about that film that you felt didn’t work? Or that you wish you could go back and change?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, but I actually watched <em>Rare Exports</em> two weeks ago, and I hadn’t seen it for many years, and now those problems didn’t bother me anymore. It’s weird. It somehow has evolved into a better film.</p>

<p><strong>Would you ever think of doing a remake where Santa Claus is really Canadian? Because we’re closer to the North Pole and our national colours are red and white…</strong></p>

<p>Well I’ve been asked to do a remake from Hollywood, but I think that would be a really big mistake. And try to imagine if you were to do that, and you get all the resources you ever wanted, and have the same story but in a bigger way, and in the end you realize something is missing, like, where is the original magic that was in the original film? That would be so terrible that I could never do that. Because it might happen, and you can never tell where it comes from. Whether it works or not.</p>

<p><strong>Your new film, <em>Big Game</em>, is about a boy who needs to prove that he’s a man by killing a big animal. Did you feel like there was a parallel there for you as a writer to prove yourself to Hollywood by shooting this big American-style action movie?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is this idea of...it’s almost like when I was a kid and I always said I was going to make a big action film and everyone always said to me that it’s a stupid dream and it’s never going to happen, and trying to get me to realize how unlikely that is to happen. But I somehow managed to get my dreams to reality and it makes me feel good. And I like that kind of underdog stories where no one believes you are going to do something really amazing. It’s always nice in a movie, and in real life.</p>

<p><strong>What about the fantasy you sort of created in the film about saving an American president. Is this a typical fantasy for a young Finnish boy?</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) I don’t think so. It just happened. We had a crazy idea with the producer and we just went with it.</p>

<p><strong>I’m sure you’re a fan of Hollywood films, but what would you say is the worst habit of Hollywood action films today?</strong></p>

<p>I think there are a lot of action films nowadays that are missing some kind of heart, or warmness. I think in the 80s or early 90s, when I was a really big action film fan, and would always go many times to see the same movie, there’s something different from what Hollywood is making now. I don’t know how to explain but something is missing.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to make a truly Hollywood film, who is one movie star you would both love to work with?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a big fan of Chris Pratt at the moment, which I think quite a lot of people are. If you look at something like <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, I think a lot of what made it a good movie was Chris Pratt, if you ask me. I think he’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>So <em>Big Game</em> sort of brings the American president to Finland, and I’m just wondering; is there a Finnish story that you would like to bring to America?</strong> </p>

<p>A lot of Finnish folklore are so dark, I don’t think it would be a big success. I already did Santa Claus which I think is a Finnish thing, although you think it’s a Canadian thing, so that’s one folklore I already did. I’m writing the next one so let’s see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Finally – is there somebody on set, like a crew member, who really just does an incredible job and you would want to bring with you on any film you ever made?</strong></p>

<p>Somebody who was super great was Kiante Elan who was the stunt guy for Samuel Jackson. He also does the stunts for Will Smith, and he was one of the nicest people I have ever met. Always in a really, really good mood, and he doesn’t have a problem with anything and he’s super talented at what he does. He’s super great</p>

<p><strong>Do you kind of see yourself doing what Quentin Tarantino did or Keanu Reeves did where they turn a stunt person into a star of one of their films? Could you ever see him being a star in one of your films?</strong></p>

<p>I definitely could see. And I think he’s done some acting also, not anything really big but definitely, yes.</p>

    <title>Terminator: Genysis</title>

    <id>/content/2015/7/4/terminator-genysis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It would be unfair to place the responsibility for the fiasco that is <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> entirely at your feet. It’s a film whose shortcomings are so varied, so composite, that they defy easy categorization. The special effects are degenerative—somehow less thrilling, less real, than they were twenty-three (!) years ago in <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day.</em> The script unfolds like something the producers acquired through Fiverr—it has all the nuance and surprise of a crowdsourced piece of fan fiction. The production feels small-scale, constrained, cheap. Even the music – which occasionally pays tribute to Brad Feidel’s clamorous carillon theme – is so vacuous and forgettable that the film may as well have been scored by radio static. </p>

<p>All of this contributes to the feeling that <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> is nothing more than a great big B-movie (and not in the efficient, self-aware manner that that first <em>Terminator</em> was a B-movie). And what really solidifies the film’s lack of ambition is that you, Ronna, <em>cast</em> it like a B-movie. Amongst all its deficiencies, this is the most grievous: the lifelessness and lack of charisma that the actors bring to the screen. It’s almost impossible to comprehend. </p>

<p>Impossible, because there are Oscar-winners among the cast. And some terrific veteran character actors. Yet, together, they form a sort of tepid mass of humanity that doesn’t inspire even the smallest bit of affection (with one important exception, which, though obvious, I’ll wait to explain). </p>

<p>Yes, Emilia Clarke looks a bit like Linda Hamilton, and on <em>Game of Thrones</em> is able to conjure a matronly aura. But here she is doing a mere impression of being matronly, stuck somewhere between the Sarah Connor of the first film – a perpetually terrified damsel in distress – and the Sarah Connor of the second, all sinewy muscle and desperate authority. Clarke just doesn’t have the presence or the range to pull it off. </p>

<p>Jason Clarke, on the other hand, possesses...something. At least everyone who saw <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> seems to think so. But when he’s given more than ten minutes of screen-time, his <em>something</em> is proven to be a finite resource. In <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em>, he was overshadowed not just by the troupe of CGI monkeys, but by virtually every other human performer as well. Here, as John Connor, the inspiring military leader who saves the human race, he inspires little more than indifference.</p>

<p>But the real centerpiece of this bromidic cast is Jai Courtenay, who now boasts a perfect two-for-two record in <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html">ruining beloved action franchises</a>.</p>

<p>I will admit that Michael Biehn, who originated the role of Kyle Reese, is no Laurence Olivier. Still, there was something in the intense sincerity with which he delivered every line, that made him seem like he came from the future, like he really was sent back on a dangerous mission. He delivered every line like it was a matter of life and death. </p>

<p>Courtney delivers his lines like he <em>is</em> dead. To say that he has no presence is inaccurate. He is a void. Like a black hole, he swallows the charisma of every orbiting body. He simply doesn’t seem to occupy quantum space as we know it. He is a man-shaped nothingness. There might as well be a square-jawed, bro-shaped hole in the movie screen; revealing, behind him, all the pulleys that control the curtain, all the wiring for the surround-sound speakers. His reaction when Sarah Connor tells him the story of her parents’ death (“The cabin blew up!”) is the stuff that Internet memes are made from; if you’ve ever wanted to see what a man’s face looks like when he’s conscious of how his eyebrows are moving, just watch that scene.  </p>

<p>But this isn’t some sprawling Robert Altman film. What do all these peripheral folks matter
? You see <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/6/12/jurassic-world.html">Jurassic Park movies</a> for the dinosaurs, and you see Terminator movies for the Terminators. And, yes, there at the center of it all is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, as he has aged, as his hair has greyed and delts have deflated, has somehow managed to become even more charismatic. </p>

<p>And that’s the miraculous thing about this fifth Terminator flick: that a franchise founded on the very inhuman blankness of it’s titular character could turn its blank, inhuman antagonist/protagonist into a complicated, evolving, sympathetic character. But it’s also the disappointing thing. Because this isn’t one of those sequels to a sequel to a sequel that has nothing new to offer the convoluted mythology. <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> introduces the very compelling idea of an aging Terminator confronting its obsolescence (“old, but not obsolete,” the T-800 keeps insisting), and Arnie brings that idea to life with a rather remarkable performance (every single ounce of charm this movie possesses is his). But the film is too busy trying to hit every action flick beat (specifically, every action flick <em>cliché</em>) to give that part of the story the attention is deserves. </p>

<p>So what are we left with? A series of inane expository conversations occasionally interrupted by some of the most unexciting, unimaginative action sequences in recent film history. Which wouldn’t be so interminable if the actors in the middle of those sequences had more charm than the cars and trucks and helicopters that were blowing up.</p>

<p>All it takes to elevate second-rate material is to put a magnetic presence in the middle of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger knows this. He’s built an entire career on it. It’s a shame you chose to surround him with such a deadly-dull gang of supporting players.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You&#39;d think a movie like <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> would be the ultimate platform for misogynistic boasting, but it was the complete opposite thanks largely to you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a fan of your no-bullshit attitude since you donned the red highlights as Fish Mooney in <em>Gotham</em>. Maybe this is why you were the perfect choice to literally lead the charge, as the emcee for a group of retiring male dancers looking for one last hoorah in the spotlight at Myrtle Beach&#39;s premiere stripper convention.</p>

<p>Frankly, you saved the movie. Aside from the mesmerizing dancing that defied all laws of physics (the human body shouldn&#39;t be able to do what Channing Tatum can do), <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> chooses to spend several chunks of screen time on dialogue that goes nowhere. You can only handle so much frat boy flirting before you tune out.</p>

<p>But when you talk, you command attention, rivalling even the ass-less-iest of ass-less chaps. I can say this because all your key moments were wedged between pivotal stripping scenes.</p>

<p>When we are introduced to your strange house of male burlesque, you remind the women in attendance that they are <em>queens.</em> If they want to watch men take off their clothes, then they should go right ahead and do it. If they want to have a one night stand with a sculpted stranger, then screw society and its labels. Most importantly, you remind them that <em>women are just like men</em>: they have sexual needs and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Your sass and bravado are enough to change the tone of the entire movie. When Matthew McConaughey was the ring leader in <em>Magic Mike</em>, he was flirtatious and coy. He knew the women were there for the men. But with you, it was evident that the men were there for the women.</p>

<p>It was a breath of fresh air to see you stand your ground. When other women buttered at the sight of a naked torso, you saw it as your job. No amount of pelvic gyrations could make you flinch.</p>

<p>It is a shame that <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> fell short. It definitely wasn&#39;t as good as the first (which was surprisingly good). Thankfully, your performance kept me intrigued when penis innuendos couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>Alright, alright, alright,</strong></p>

    <id>/content/2015/6/26/ted-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>When kids play with one of your Nerf toys, or adults sit down with your classic board game Clue, their goal is to turn off part of their brains and just enjoy themselves for an hour or two. The same is true of stupid comedies. Maybe this is why it makes sense that you’re a part of the stoner buddy-movie sequel <em>Ted 2</em>. Who would know better than you that sometimes people just want to have fun without searching for some deeper purpose? And yet, surprisingly, there are moments when <em>Ted 2</em> manages to do both.</p>

<p>The original 2012 movie, <em>Ted</em>, was about the bond between man-child John Bennett and his best friend, a stuffed bear who magically came to life when John was 8 years-old. As adults, John and Ted are lovable slackers grappling with the future of their friendship. <em>Ted 2</em> picks up three years after the end of the first film, and focuses on Ted and his brassy wife Tami-Lynn’s attempts to have a child. In order to do so, Ted must go to court to legally establish himself as a living person so that he can be recognized by the government of the United States, and not merely as property.</p>

<p>For a children’s toy company, you took a big Risk (pun wholly intended) participating in a raunchy R-rated flick. Not only do you lend your company name and products to the film, but you’re an integral part of the plot. While Ted’s civil rights trial is heating up, his creeptastic stalker, Donnie (now a janitor at Hasbro), hatches a scheme to rig Ted’s trial so he loses and will be legally considered property. Donnie convinces your CEO to go along with his plot, and to kidnap Ted after the trial. Then Hasbro can dissect him to find out how he became “real” and manufacture billions of Teds. </p>

<p>Sound ridiculous? Of course it is. It’s a movie about a dirty-talking, pot-smoking Teddy bear. But it’s no more ridiculous than your Furby dolls, and people <em>love</em> those stupid things. Writer/Producer/Director Seth MacFarlane goes back to the hilariously vulgar trough that supplied many of the laughs in the first film, including pop culture references, celebrity cameos, and defiant political incorrectness. If homages to films like <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>Planes, Trains and Automobile</em>s, scenes of Liam Neeson buying cereal, and Ted sarcastically comparing his struggle to that of Kunta Kinte doesn’t entertain you, it might be better for you to spend your evening playing an endless game of Monopoly (which you should know will invariably end with one of your friends screaming “fuck this!” and flipping the board over).</p>

<p>Even when the film takes a moral stand – and it <em>does</em> make some salient points about human rights and the concept of personhood – it does so with tongue planted firmly in furry cheek. Patrick Stewart’s narration reminds us right at the beginning of the film that “America doesn’t give a shit about anything.” Except, maybe, corporations making money. And you certainly took advantage of your position, Hasbro, showing off many of your products. One of the film’s major locations is the New York Comicon, where you are boldly represented by giant Transformers, Nerf guns, and Play-Doh displays. Usually this kind of brazen product placement sours my palate, but I was too busy laughing at the nerd fight involving characters like Daleks, Gollum, and Doc and Marty from <em>Back to the Future</em>. Patrick Warburton, who reprises his role as the gay dude-bro Guy, shows up dressed exactly as you would expect Patrick Warburton to dress. There’s nothing your aggressive branding could have done to undermine <em>that</em> image.</p>

<p>Even though there’s not much new in this installment, beyond the addition of Amanda Seyfried as Ted’s pot smoking lawyer (and John’s eventual love interest) Samantha, it’s still fun to go slumming in Ted and John’s world—for 115 minutes, at least. Yes, Ted is a CGI invention, but somehow he and Mark Wahlberg manage to have better chemistry than most humans in a buddy-comedy are able to generate. They have a shorthand that feels familiar. They’re the kind of like friends you’d get drunk and play Jenga with—just not very often. Sometimes giving people exactly what they expect isn’t such a bad thing (but as the co-owners of the <em>Transformers</em> movie franchise, I surely don’t have to tell you that).</p>

<p>One of the best things about playing your board games as an adult is that it reminds me of how much fun I had playing them as a kid. In a predictably inappropriate way, <em>Ted 2</em> invoked a similar response. In the 80s, R-Rated comedies –  <em>Fast Times at</em> <em>Ridgemont</em> <em>High, Blues Brothers,</em> <em>Caddyshack</em> –  had something many of today’s R-Rated comedies are missing: a bit of heart. And <em>Ted 2,</em> despite its immaturity and vulgarity, manages to slip in some warm and fuzzies. When Ted’s case makes it to the Supreme Court, his high-profile lawyer (in a cameo that should remain unnamed) reminds him that, “the public doesn’t judge by reason, it judges by emotion.” </p>

<p>So, thanks for all the toys and board games that allowed me to goof off during my childhood, and for contributing to the two hours I wasted on <em>Ted 2</em>.  </p>

<p>But that still doesn’t mean you’re off the hook for what you did to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/black-widow-gets-replaced-by-captain-america-on-118893025097.html">Black Widow</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>This will come as no surprise to you, but you don’t actually appear in this movie. I’m not going to let that stop me from wishing you did.</p>

<p>You and director Michael Winterbottom have collaborated so often that you can’t blame me for picturing you as the lead of his latest film, <em>The Face of An Angel</em>. This wannabe sexy thriller takes itself so seriously that it’s almost a comedy. <em>Almost.</em> Unfortunately, we don’t have your deadpan delivery to exaggerate the pomposity of a film about yet another white male having an existential crisis. </p>

<p><em>The Face of An Angel</em> purports to tell the story of the real-life murder of exchange-student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy in 2007. Kercher’s roommate, Amanda Knox, along with Knox’s boyfriend and another man were convicted (and in Knox’ case, eventually acquitted) of the murder—but instead, we suffer alongside Daniel Bruhl (an actor far too talented and interesting to have been wasted on this wank) who, as a filmmaker named Thomas, is searching for an angle from which to tell the story as a movie. Thomas – who is wrestling with dark thoughts about his ex-wife (a starlet who cheated on him with her co-star), and feeling alienated from his young daughter – begins to unravel in his attempts to make sense of the infamous murder case.  </p>

<p>The film starts out cleverly enough, with Thomas meeting Simone, a savvy journalist who has written a book about the case. Simone advises Thomas to write his script as fiction to avoid a lawsuit, telling him there were many things she couldn’t include in her book because they were true. This bit of exposition gives Winterbottom creative license with the story.  Names and locations are substituted, but the details of the notorious case remain the same. </p>

<p>This should have been the first clue that my excitement about a director as skilled as Winterbottom taking on a story as twisted as the Amanda Knox case was perhaps misdirected. </p>

<p>The character of Thomas seems almost to be a proxy for you, Steve—at least the meta-version of you from films like <em>The Trip</em>: smug, prone to jealousy, chases women half his age, an absentee father, known to overindulge. It almost seems like your friend Michael saw this as a comedic role for you, and when you couldn’t commit, he threw his hands up and said, “bugger it all, I’ll just make it a thriller.” </p>

<p>I hope you regret turning it down. Thomas becomes obsessed with telling the story using Dante’s Inferno as a device, which would explain the unintentionally funny CGI demons that attack Thomas in dark cobblestone alleys and his laughably perverse coke-fueled visions, which look like something from an episode of <em>Criminal Minds</em>. Just think of how much fun you would have had filming <em>that!</em> </p>

<p>Thomas has a brief fling with Simone, probably because he’s attracted to how well she delivers exposition (she doesn’t do much else). He enters into a weird relationship with Melanie, a barely-legal student and subdued British version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. It would have been a thrill to watch you navigate between these two women with your trademark pretentious incompetence. Instead, we’re subjected to countless scenes of Bruhl brooding in cars, trattorias, and on Tuscan hotel balconies. </p>

<p>Winterbottom seems genuinely interested in reminding us that Sarah (Meredith Kercher’s proxy) was a person, and not just the victim of a sex crime (going so far as to dedicate the film to Kercher). Thomas is forever at odds with the tabloid reporters and TV execs who are intent on exploiting every detail, however salacious, about the schoolgirl’s murder. In these moments – when Thomas interacts with the world-weary, cynical journos – Winterbottom recalls some of the brilliance of his 1997 film <em>Welcome to Sarajevo.</em> Lines like, ”trials are like <em>X-Factor</em>; if they like your face, you win,” are biting and true. But the impact of these statements is immediately undercut by Thomas’ incessant whining about “telling the truth, <em>dammit!</em>” Scenes in which Thomas has to endure a studio exec’s inane feedback are played so flatly they almost disappear. In your hands, Steve, these exchanges would have been just as grating and bloviated, but way more fun to watch. Without your dry comic timing, Winterbottom’s points come across as butthurt complaints instead of cutting observations.</p>

<p>Your inimitable talents would have completely changed the tone of the film, which swings from dull to ridiculous and back again without any sense of irony. You’ve made a tidy living (and a devoted fan base) capitalizing on your innate ability to be comically unselfaware yet tragically self-absorbed. Who better to play a narcissistic filmmaker? All your best roles – Alan Partridge, Tony Wilson in <em>24 Hour Party People</em>, and yourself in <em>Tristram Shandy</em> – are unsympathetic characters who mask their deep insecurities with arrogance. I have every confidence that, with you in the lead, <em>The Face of an Angel</em> would have been a sharp and dark comic meditation on tabloid journalism and the public’s insatiable thirst for scandal. It would also have <em>taken the piss</em> (as you Brits say) out of the self-important filmmakers who fancy themselves truth-tellers. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, your friend Michael just wasn’t in on the joke this time.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/6/22/inside-out</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You did a lot more than write the screenplay for <em>Inside Out</em>. Along with Ronaldo Del Carmen you also developed the original story and co-directed it. But I want to talk about how <em>Inside Out</em> is structured as a story, so “Co-screenwriter” is going to have to do for now.</p>

<p>See, there’s something about the way <em>Inside Out</em> is constructed that is just so very Pixar. There is no fat on the film – everything is there for a reason, and story ideas that are planted early come to fruition in unexpected but wholly satisfying ways. The emotional crisis of a preteen girl named Riley – told mainly from within her own head where each emotion is a character running the human brain as a day job– is certainly an unexpected concept from a studio that has been focusing lately more on sequels and prequels. You helped create the original <em>Monsters Inc.</em> and the glorious <em>Up</em>, after all. I don’t think it’s in your nature to make something completely unoriginal. </p>

<p>A lot of care and thinking has been put into every moment we see on screen, not matter how small. You can feel the guiding hand of what Ed Catmull detailed in his book about Pixar’s creative process, <em>Creativity Inc.</em>: when a film is in development at Pixar, it is subjected to relentless group discussions where every aspect of it is scrutinized and questioned until what is left is hopefully the purest story possible. Every character, every beat, every turn in <em>Inside Out</em> has been scrutinized by Pixar’s core creative team, whether any of their names appear in the credits or not. Inside and out, <em>Inside Out</em> is every inch a Pixar film – and that’s what caused a bit of a crisis for me as a viewer. </p>

<p>More on that later – let’s look at everything else first.</p>

<p>Being a Pixar production doesn&#39;t just impact story development. Everything single thing on screen is meticulously devised. The production design and working details of Riley’s emotions are both beautiful and hilarious. You’ve spoken before about how much of an influence Hayao Miyazaki’s work has had on you as an artist, and the way you combine—and fully embrace—the everyday drama of life and absurd whimsy, without a need to completely reconcile the two. This makes you perhaps the most Miyazaki-like of Pixar’s directors. The characters that run Riley’s emotions—Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness—look almost fairy-like, with an oh-so-slight glowing shimmer that follows them (Anger’s head literally shoots flames, adding to the supernatural element). The world of Riley’s consciousness feels like a candy-colored version of the spirit world Miyazaki’s <em>Spirited Away</em>. It has its own social order, rules and characters that all have jobs to do and want things to work the way they’re supposed to because that’s how it’s always been. Like Miyazaki’s spirits, the last thing anyone needs is something upsetting the status quo.</p>

<p>Of all the characters running Riley’s brain, the one who most wants things to never change is Joy. Played with her unique combination of pluck, desperation and maddeningly cheerful aggression, Amy Poehler makes Joy the Leslie Knope of the id. She sees herself as the leader of the five emotions, and is set on making sure Riley’s daily life and memories have the least amount of possible stress. So of course when developing this story, Pete, you made sure that a series of accidents and good intentions gone wrong lead Joy to get tossed from her safe spot in HQ to the wilds of Riley’s subconscious with the one emotion she is least equipped to deal with: Sadness.</p>

<p>This brings me back to my point of crisis. You knew to do this from a story point of view because you’ve done it before: the two quarrelling characters that get tossed from the safety of their privileged position and need to make their way back through a series of obstacles is taken right from the <em>Toy Story</em> playbook (a playbook you also co-wrote). Joy’s constant exasperation with Sadness’s refusal to accept her place and stay out of Joy’s way has much in common with the Woody/Buzz Lightyear dynamic. Both characters here are funny and original—and Phyllis Smith’s voice work as Sadness is at least on par with Poehler’s—but we’ve seen this situation before.</p>

<p>Similarly, the “it’s just a job” take on the inner workings of the human psyche has a decidedly <em>Monsters Inc.</em> bent to it. As these familiar elements came to my mind while watching <em>Inside Out,</em> I questioned whether you and your team had taken the safe route on your journey, choosing the tried and true in place of the actually new. Worried that Pixar’s iterative, group-based story development could be so good at distilling out story impurities that what was left, while pure, was also becoming homogenized, that the personal quirks were being lost to group consensus.</p>

<p>But, put simply, that’s my problem to deal with, not <em>Inside Out</em>’s—I can’t judge a film for what I think might have been there. The only responsibility you and the entire production team have is to the film. If the film works (and it does), then whatever baggage I bring based on your or your studio’s previous works is mine and mine alone. And I think I can see why you wanted to make these familiar choices: you’ve anchored your entire story on the emotional breakdown of an 11-year old girl. That’s a bold choice for what is being sold as a fun night out with those goofy guys from Pixar. You use those familiar elements to pull off quite the balancing act: what Riley is experiencing with Joy and Sadness missing from her psyche is pretty heavy stuff, and probably not what a general audience will be expecting when they purchase their tickets. Emotional shutdown isn’t usually associated with a fun time at the movies, after all.</p>

<p>I’m not going to complain if you want to support a story this potentially upsetting (especially for those close in age to Riley, not to mention their parents) with elements that make us all feel a little more at ease, or let us know a steady hand is guiding us through the rough terrain. (I will, however, complain just a little bit about the various themed “lands”  in Riley’s brain that felt pre-designed to work in a new Disney attraction – I can already imagine lineups for the “Don’t Touch the Lava” obstacle course.)</p>

<p>When the familiar and the unexpected work in concert, they influence each other. As we invest more in Riley, we imbue every small moment, every reaction she can’t even explain to herself with a weight that most summer blockbusters can’t generate by threatening to destroy the entire planet Earth. And characters that seem introduced only to generate laughs become tragic figures when they realize the role they have to play in Riley’s mental development—a role that is as heartbreaking for their acceptance of it as it is in its inevitability. You had me so hooked on the familiar storytelling that I didn’t even realize how invested I was in Riley’s story – I had my own emotional reaction that I couldn’t explain. </p>

<p>At least not until I could sit back a bit and admire your craft from a distance.</p>
