    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I didn’t like your movie <em>Big Game</em> very much, but my real argument with you is less about the quality of your particular film and more to do with a larger issue.</p>

<p>First though, here’s why I didn’t enjoy <em>Big Game specifically. The film was poorly written, unimaginatively shot, the performances were flat and uninteresting, and while you got Sam Jackson for the lead, Kyle MacLachlan could have easily replaced him and no one would have noticed, the part was so one dimensional. Still, much of that can be forgiven if the film is innovative or even just energetic, but _Big Game</em> was the worst of all possible things an action movie could be—it was irredeemably dull. My god, it was dull. Like sitting-on-the-bus-head–nodding-wondering–if- you-were-drooling-dull.</p>

<p>My real complaint has to do with something less concrete, but perhaps in the long run more important. While it is impossible, or maybe just pointless, to try and make qualitative distinctions about capital A art—is Picasso’s <em>Guernica</em> in some way better than Da Vinci’s <em>Mona Lisa</em>—it is entirely possible to make those kind of distinctions about entertainments. Every artist may be a thief, but if you are stealing sub standard material to begin with then the whole project can’t help but suck. It is here that I really have a bone to pick with you. </p>

<p>I have a hard time understanding why some people fetishize certain films from certain eras. There is, in particular, a tendency to point to the late eighties and into the nineties as some golden age for action films. Films like John McTiernan’s <em>Die Hard</em> (1988) or his <em>Predator</em> (1987) are just two examples that people often talk about in bafflingly reverent terms. In your case it is hard not to cite Wolfgang Peterson’s <em>Air Force One or 1993’s _The Fugitive as obviously carrying some weight with you, since these films so clearly influence _Big Game.</em></p>

<p>All of these were just fine as straightforward entertainments, fun to watch, kitschy in a good way, but for the most part they suffer in comparison to the best stuff being made now. There is a simple reason for that. Since they were hardly transcendent entertainments at the time, they will always suffer with age. They won’t look as good, the stunts aren’t as impressive, the camera work is constrained by technical concerns and the filmmaker’s imagination is circumscribed by what it is possible to actually show onscreen. </p>

<p>While the very best entertainments seem visually timeless (<em>Blade Runner</em> is perhaps the best example of that truth) they were, and still remain, superior in terms of performance, themes and creative execution—the imagination informing the story makes it onto the screen. So regardless of the advances in the technical aspects of filmmaking—CGI, smaller cameras, better and more dangerous stunt work—films like <em>Alien</em> and <em>Raider’s of The Lost Ark</em> still stand head and shoulders above most. This is because the more abstract facets of the craft—performance, direction, art direction, storytelling, editing—don’t suffer as much with age.</p>

<p>But when you set out to make a b-film, a straight up actioner without any pretensions, I can’t imagine why you would go the way you did, Jalmari. Instead of taking advantage of all the latest technical innovations and possibilities inherent in them, you went the other way. Instead of <em>Raid Redemption</em> you made some pale echo of _Patriot Games. </p>

<p>Here is my entirely unsolicited advice. Don’t waste your budget on Sam Jackson if you aren’t going to use him properly. Instead, invest in some go-pro’s and some stunt work and make use of that unbelievable Finnish landscape. Tell me a mildly interesting story instead of this stupid, derivative crap that parrots stuff that wasn’t that good in the first place.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/7/8/a-conversation-with-director-jalmari-helander</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Finnish director Jalmari Helander is breaking into the Hollywood game with a new actioner starring Samuel Jackson – <em>Big Game</em>. We talk about his breakout success film <em>Rare Exports</em>, what’s wrong with most action movies today, and who he wants to make the next big action star. </p>

<p><strong>Let’s start by talking about <em>Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010)</em>. The movie quickly became a cult classic, at least here in Canada. What was your goal in creating that film?</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t have any kinds of goals. I tried to survive the whole thing and get the movie done. That was my goal. I also had a goal to make a different kind of Finnish movie, because in Finland all the movies are really boring, and I wanted to do something else and I’m really glad it worked out.</p>

<p><strong>What were some of the things you learned when you were making that movie?</strong> </p>

<p>Well of course I learned quite a lot. It was my first feature film. I have to say that the biggest lesson I learned was that if something doesn’t work in the script it will not work when we’re shooting it, and it will give you nightmares. You have to solve that problem when you are writing, it’s not going to solve itself later on. That’s my biggest lesson ever.</p>

<p><strong>Were there things about that film that you felt didn’t work? Or that you wish you could go back and change?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, but I actually watched <em>Rare Exports</em> two weeks ago, and I hadn’t seen it for many years, and now those problems didn’t bother me anymore. It’s weird. It somehow has evolved into a better film.</p>

<p><strong>Would you ever think of doing a remake where Santa Claus is really Canadian? Because we’re closer to the North Pole and our national colours are red and white…</strong></p>

<p>Well I’ve been asked to do a remake from Hollywood, but I think that would be a really big mistake. And try to imagine if you were to do that, and you get all the resources you ever wanted, and have the same story but in a bigger way, and in the end you realize something is missing, like, where is the original magic that was in the original film? That would be so terrible that I could never do that. Because it might happen, and you can never tell where it comes from. Whether it works or not.</p>

<p><strong>Your new film, <em>Big Game</em>, is about a boy who needs to prove that he’s a man by killing a big animal. Did you feel like there was a parallel there for you as a writer to prove yourself to Hollywood by shooting this big American-style action movie?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is this idea of...it’s almost like when I was a kid and I always said I was going to make a big action film and everyone always said to me that it’s a stupid dream and it’s never going to happen, and trying to get me to realize how unlikely that is to happen. But I somehow managed to get my dreams to reality and it makes me feel good. And I like that kind of underdog stories where no one believes you are going to do something really amazing. It’s always nice in a movie, and in real life.</p>

<p><strong>What about the fantasy you sort of created in the film about saving an American president. Is this a typical fantasy for a young Finnish boy?</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) I don’t think so. It just happened. We had a crazy idea with the producer and we just went with it.</p>

<p><strong>I’m sure you’re a fan of Hollywood films, but what would you say is the worst habit of Hollywood action films today?</strong></p>

<p>I think there are a lot of action films nowadays that are missing some kind of heart, or warmness. I think in the 80s or early 90s, when I was a really big action film fan, and would always go many times to see the same movie, there’s something different from what Hollywood is making now. I don’t know how to explain but something is missing.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to make a truly Hollywood film, who is one movie star you would both love to work with?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a big fan of Chris Pratt at the moment, which I think quite a lot of people are. If you look at something like <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, I think a lot of what made it a good movie was Chris Pratt, if you ask me. I think he’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>So <em>Big Game</em> sort of brings the American president to Finland, and I’m just wondering; is there a Finnish story that you would like to bring to America?</strong> </p>

<p>A lot of Finnish folklore are so dark, I don’t think it would be a big success. I already did Santa Claus which I think is a Finnish thing, although you think it’s a Canadian thing, so that’s one folklore I already did. I’m writing the next one so let’s see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Finally – is there somebody on set, like a crew member, who really just does an incredible job and you would want to bring with you on any film you ever made?</strong></p>

<p>Somebody who was super great was Kiante Elan who was the stunt guy for Samuel Jackson. He also does the stunts for Will Smith, and he was one of the nicest people I have ever met. Always in a really, really good mood, and he doesn’t have a problem with anything and he’s super talented at what he does. He’s super great</p>

<p><strong>Do you kind of see yourself doing what Quentin Tarantino did or Keanu Reeves did where they turn a stunt person into a star of one of their films? Could you ever see him being a star in one of your films?</strong></p>

<p>I definitely could see. And I think he’s done some acting also, not anything really big but definitely, yes.</p>

    <title>Terminator: Genysis</title>

    <id>/content/2015/7/4/terminator-genysis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It would be unfair to place the responsibility for the fiasco that is <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> entirely at your feet. It’s a film whose shortcomings are so varied, so composite, that they defy easy categorization. The special effects are degenerative—somehow less thrilling, less real, than they were twenty-three (!) years ago in <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day.</em> The script unfolds like something the producers acquired through Fiverr—it has all the nuance and surprise of a crowdsourced piece of fan fiction. The production feels small-scale, constrained, cheap. Even the music – which occasionally pays tribute to Brad Feidel’s clamorous carillon theme – is so vacuous and forgettable that the film may as well have been scored by radio static. </p>

<p>All of this contributes to the feeling that <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> is nothing more than a great big B-movie (and not in the efficient, self-aware manner that that first <em>Terminator</em> was a B-movie). And what really solidifies the film’s lack of ambition is that you, Ronna, <em>cast</em> it like a B-movie. Amongst all its deficiencies, this is the most grievous: the lifelessness and lack of charisma that the actors bring to the screen. It’s almost impossible to comprehend. </p>

<p>Impossible, because there are Oscar-winners among the cast. And some terrific veteran character actors. Yet, together, they form a sort of tepid mass of humanity that doesn’t inspire even the smallest bit of affection (with one important exception, which, though obvious, I’ll wait to explain). </p>

<p>Yes, Emilia Clarke looks a bit like Linda Hamilton, and on <em>Game of Thrones</em> is able to conjure a matronly aura. But here she is doing a mere impression of being matronly, stuck somewhere between the Sarah Connor of the first film – a perpetually terrified damsel in distress – and the Sarah Connor of the second, all sinewy muscle and desperate authority. Clarke just doesn’t have the presence or the range to pull it off. </p>

<p>Jason Clarke, on the other hand, possesses...something. At least everyone who saw <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> seems to think so. But when he’s given more than ten minutes of screen-time, his <em>something</em> is proven to be a finite resource. In <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em>, he was overshadowed not just by the troupe of CGI monkeys, but by virtually every other human performer as well. Here, as John Connor, the inspiring military leader who saves the human race, he inspires little more than indifference.</p>

<p>But the real centerpiece of this bromidic cast is Jai Courtenay, who now boasts a perfect two-for-two record in <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html">ruining beloved action franchises</a>.</p>

<p>I will admit that Michael Biehn, who originated the role of Kyle Reese, is no Laurence Olivier. Still, there was something in the intense sincerity with which he delivered every line, that made him seem like he came from the future, like he really was sent back on a dangerous mission. He delivered every line like it was a matter of life and death. </p>

<p>Courtney delivers his lines like he <em>is</em> dead. To say that he has no presence is inaccurate. He is a void. Like a black hole, he swallows the charisma of every orbiting body. He simply doesn’t seem to occupy quantum space as we know it. He is a man-shaped nothingness. There might as well be a square-jawed, bro-shaped hole in the movie screen; revealing, behind him, all the pulleys that control the curtain, all the wiring for the surround-sound speakers. His reaction when Sarah Connor tells him the story of her parents’ death (“The cabin blew up!”) is the stuff that Internet memes are made from; if you’ve ever wanted to see what a man’s face looks like when he’s conscious of how his eyebrows are moving, just watch that scene.  </p>

<p>But this isn’t some sprawling Robert Altman film. What do all these peripheral folks matter
? You see <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/6/12/jurassic-world.html">Jurassic Park movies</a> for the dinosaurs, and you see Terminator movies for the Terminators. And, yes, there at the center of it all is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, as he has aged, as his hair has greyed and delts have deflated, has somehow managed to become even more charismatic. </p>

<p>And that’s the miraculous thing about this fifth Terminator flick: that a franchise founded on the very inhuman blankness of it’s titular character could turn its blank, inhuman antagonist/protagonist into a complicated, evolving, sympathetic character. But it’s also the disappointing thing. Because this isn’t one of those sequels to a sequel to a sequel that has nothing new to offer the convoluted mythology. <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> introduces the very compelling idea of an aging Terminator confronting its obsolescence (“old, but not obsolete,” the T-800 keeps insisting), and Arnie brings that idea to life with a rather remarkable performance (every single ounce of charm this movie possesses is his). But the film is too busy trying to hit every action flick beat (specifically, every action flick <em>cliché</em>) to give that part of the story the attention is deserves. </p>

<p>So what are we left with? A series of inane expository conversations occasionally interrupted by some of the most unexciting, unimaginative action sequences in recent film history. Which wouldn’t be so interminable if the actors in the middle of those sequences had more charm than the cars and trucks and helicopters that were blowing up.</p>

<p>All it takes to elevate second-rate material is to put a magnetic presence in the middle of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger knows this. He’s built an entire career on it. It’s a shame you chose to surround him with such a deadly-dull gang of supporting players.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You&#39;d think a movie like <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> would be the ultimate platform for misogynistic boasting, but it was the complete opposite thanks largely to you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a fan of your no-bullshit attitude since you donned the red highlights as Fish Mooney in <em>Gotham</em>. Maybe this is why you were the perfect choice to literally lead the charge, as the emcee for a group of retiring male dancers looking for one last hoorah in the spotlight at Myrtle Beach&#39;s premiere stripper convention.</p>

<p>Frankly, you saved the movie. Aside from the mesmerizing dancing that defied all laws of physics (the human body shouldn&#39;t be able to do what Channing Tatum can do), <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> chooses to spend several chunks of screen time on dialogue that goes nowhere. You can only handle so much frat boy flirting before you tune out.</p>

<p>But when you talk, you command attention, rivalling even the ass-less-iest of ass-less chaps. I can say this because all your key moments were wedged between pivotal stripping scenes.</p>

<p>When we are introduced to your strange house of male burlesque, you remind the women in attendance that they are <em>queens.</em> If they want to watch men take off their clothes, then they should go right ahead and do it. If they want to have a one night stand with a sculpted stranger, then screw society and its labels. Most importantly, you remind them that <em>women are just like men</em>: they have sexual needs and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Your sass and bravado are enough to change the tone of the entire movie. When Matthew McConaughey was the ring leader in <em>Magic Mike</em>, he was flirtatious and coy. He knew the women were there for the men. But with you, it was evident that the men were there for the women.</p>

<p>It was a breath of fresh air to see you stand your ground. When other women buttered at the sight of a naked torso, you saw it as your job. No amount of pelvic gyrations could make you flinch.</p>

<p>It is a shame that <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> fell short. It definitely wasn&#39;t as good as the first (which was surprisingly good). Thankfully, your performance kept me intrigued when penis innuendos couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>Alright, alright, alright,</strong></p>

    <title>Ted 2</title>

    <id>/content/2015/6/26/ted-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>When kids play with one of your Nerf toys, or adults sit down with your classic board game Clue, their goal is to turn off part of their brains and just enjoy themselves for an hour or two. The same is true of stupid comedies. Maybe this is why it makes sense that you’re a part of the stoner buddy-movie sequel <em>Ted 2</em>. Who would know better than you that sometimes people just want to have fun without searching for some deeper purpose? And yet, surprisingly, there are moments when <em>Ted 2</em> manages to do both.</p>

<p>The original 2012 movie, <em>Ted</em>, was about the bond between man-child John Bennett and his best friend, a stuffed bear who magically came to life when John was 8 years-old. As adults, John and Ted are lovable slackers grappling with the future of their friendship. <em>Ted 2</em> picks up three years after the end of the first film, and focuses on Ted and his brassy wife Tami-Lynn’s attempts to have a child. In order to do so, Ted must go to court to legally establish himself as a living person so that he can be recognized by the government of the United States, and not merely as property.</p>

<p>For a children’s toy company, you took a big Risk (pun wholly intended) participating in a raunchy R-rated flick. Not only do you lend your company name and products to the film, but you’re an integral part of the plot. While Ted’s civil rights trial is heating up, his creeptastic stalker, Donnie (now a janitor at Hasbro), hatches a scheme to rig Ted’s trial so he loses and will be legally considered property. Donnie convinces your CEO to go along with his plot, and to kidnap Ted after the trial. Then Hasbro can dissect him to find out how he became “real” and manufacture billions of Teds. </p>

<p>Sound ridiculous? Of course it is. It’s a movie about a dirty-talking, pot-smoking Teddy bear. But it’s no more ridiculous than your Furby dolls, and people <em>love</em> those stupid things. Writer/Producer/Director Seth MacFarlane goes back to the hilariously vulgar trough that supplied many of the laughs in the first film, including pop culture references, celebrity cameos, and defiant political incorrectness. If homages to films like <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>Planes, Trains and Automobile</em>s, scenes of Liam Neeson buying cereal, and Ted sarcastically comparing his struggle to that of Kunta Kinte doesn’t entertain you, it might be better for you to spend your evening playing an endless game of Monopoly (which you should know will invariably end with one of your friends screaming “fuck this!” and flipping the board over).</p>

<p>Even when the film takes a moral stand – and it <em>does</em> make some salient points about human rights and the concept of personhood – it does so with tongue planted firmly in furry cheek. Patrick Stewart’s narration reminds us right at the beginning of the film that “America doesn’t give a shit about anything.” Except, maybe, corporations making money. And you certainly took advantage of your position, Hasbro, showing off many of your products. One of the film’s major locations is the New York Comicon, where you are boldly represented by giant Transformers, Nerf guns, and Play-Doh displays. Usually this kind of brazen product placement sours my palate, but I was too busy laughing at the nerd fight involving characters like Daleks, Gollum, and Doc and Marty from <em>Back to the Future</em>. Patrick Warburton, who reprises his role as the gay dude-bro Guy, shows up dressed exactly as you would expect Patrick Warburton to dress. There’s nothing your aggressive branding could have done to undermine <em>that</em> image.</p>

<p>Even though there’s not much new in this installment, beyond the addition of Amanda Seyfried as Ted’s pot smoking lawyer (and John’s eventual love interest) Samantha, it’s still fun to go slumming in Ted and John’s world—for 115 minutes, at least. Yes, Ted is a CGI invention, but somehow he and Mark Wahlberg manage to have better chemistry than most humans in a buddy-comedy are able to generate. They have a shorthand that feels familiar. They’re the kind of like friends you’d get drunk and play Jenga with—just not very often. Sometimes giving people exactly what they expect isn’t such a bad thing (but as the co-owners of the <em>Transformers</em> movie franchise, I surely don’t have to tell you that).</p>

<p>One of the best things about playing your board games as an adult is that it reminds me of how much fun I had playing them as a kid. In a predictably inappropriate way, <em>Ted 2</em> invoked a similar response. In the 80s, R-Rated comedies –  <em>Fast Times at</em> <em>Ridgemont</em> <em>High, Blues Brothers,</em> <em>Caddyshack</em> –  had something many of today’s R-Rated comedies are missing: a bit of heart. And <em>Ted 2,</em> despite its immaturity and vulgarity, manages to slip in some warm and fuzzies. When Ted’s case makes it to the Supreme Court, his high-profile lawyer (in a cameo that should remain unnamed) reminds him that, “the public doesn’t judge by reason, it judges by emotion.” </p>

<p>So, thanks for all the toys and board games that allowed me to goof off during my childhood, and for contributing to the two hours I wasted on <em>Ted 2</em>.  </p>

<p>But that still doesn’t mean you’re off the hook for what you did to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/black-widow-gets-replaced-by-captain-america-on-118893025097.html">Black Widow</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>This will come as no surprise to you, but you don’t actually appear in this movie. I’m not going to let that stop me from wishing you did.</p>

<p>You and director Michael Winterbottom have collaborated so often that you can’t blame me for picturing you as the lead of his latest film, <em>The Face of An Angel</em>. This wannabe sexy thriller takes itself so seriously that it’s almost a comedy. <em>Almost.</em> Unfortunately, we don’t have your deadpan delivery to exaggerate the pomposity of a film about yet another white male having an existential crisis. </p>

<p><em>The Face of An Angel</em> purports to tell the story of the real-life murder of exchange-student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy in 2007. Kercher’s roommate, Amanda Knox, along with Knox’s boyfriend and another man were convicted (and in Knox’ case, eventually acquitted) of the murder—but instead, we suffer alongside Daniel Bruhl (an actor far too talented and interesting to have been wasted on this wank) who, as a filmmaker named Thomas, is searching for an angle from which to tell the story as a movie. Thomas – who is wrestling with dark thoughts about his ex-wife (a starlet who cheated on him with her co-star), and feeling alienated from his young daughter – begins to unravel in his attempts to make sense of the infamous murder case.  </p>

<p>The film starts out cleverly enough, with Thomas meeting Simone, a savvy journalist who has written a book about the case. Simone advises Thomas to write his script as fiction to avoid a lawsuit, telling him there were many things she couldn’t include in her book because they were true. This bit of exposition gives Winterbottom creative license with the story.  Names and locations are substituted, but the details of the notorious case remain the same. </p>

<p>This should have been the first clue that my excitement about a director as skilled as Winterbottom taking on a story as twisted as the Amanda Knox case was perhaps misdirected. </p>

<p>The character of Thomas seems almost to be a proxy for you, Steve—at least the meta-version of you from films like <em>The Trip</em>: smug, prone to jealousy, chases women half his age, an absentee father, known to overindulge. It almost seems like your friend Michael saw this as a comedic role for you, and when you couldn’t commit, he threw his hands up and said, “bugger it all, I’ll just make it a thriller.” </p>

<p>I hope you regret turning it down. Thomas becomes obsessed with telling the story using Dante’s Inferno as a device, which would explain the unintentionally funny CGI demons that attack Thomas in dark cobblestone alleys and his laughably perverse coke-fueled visions, which look like something from an episode of <em>Criminal Minds</em>. Just think of how much fun you would have had filming <em>that!</em> </p>

<p>Thomas has a brief fling with Simone, probably because he’s attracted to how well she delivers exposition (she doesn’t do much else). He enters into a weird relationship with Melanie, a barely-legal student and subdued British version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. It would have been a thrill to watch you navigate between these two women with your trademark pretentious incompetence. Instead, we’re subjected to countless scenes of Bruhl brooding in cars, trattorias, and on Tuscan hotel balconies. </p>

<p>Winterbottom seems genuinely interested in reminding us that Sarah (Meredith Kercher’s proxy) was a person, and not just the victim of a sex crime (going so far as to dedicate the film to Kercher). Thomas is forever at odds with the tabloid reporters and TV execs who are intent on exploiting every detail, however salacious, about the schoolgirl’s murder. In these moments – when Thomas interacts with the world-weary, cynical journos – Winterbottom recalls some of the brilliance of his 1997 film <em>Welcome to Sarajevo.</em> Lines like, ”trials are like <em>X-Factor</em>; if they like your face, you win,” are biting and true. But the impact of these statements is immediately undercut by Thomas’ incessant whining about “telling the truth, <em>dammit!</em>” Scenes in which Thomas has to endure a studio exec’s inane feedback are played so flatly they almost disappear. In your hands, Steve, these exchanges would have been just as grating and bloviated, but way more fun to watch. Without your dry comic timing, Winterbottom’s points come across as butthurt complaints instead of cutting observations.</p>

<p>Your inimitable talents would have completely changed the tone of the film, which swings from dull to ridiculous and back again without any sense of irony. You’ve made a tidy living (and a devoted fan base) capitalizing on your innate ability to be comically unselfaware yet tragically self-absorbed. Who better to play a narcissistic filmmaker? All your best roles – Alan Partridge, Tony Wilson in <em>24 Hour Party People</em>, and yourself in <em>Tristram Shandy</em> – are unsympathetic characters who mask their deep insecurities with arrogance. I have every confidence that, with you in the lead, <em>The Face of an Angel</em> would have been a sharp and dark comic meditation on tabloid journalism and the public’s insatiable thirst for scandal. It would also have <em>taken the piss</em> (as you Brits say) out of the self-important filmmakers who fancy themselves truth-tellers. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, your friend Michael just wasn’t in on the joke this time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You did a lot more than write the screenplay for <em>Inside Out</em>. Along with Ronaldo Del Carmen you also developed the original story and co-directed it. But I want to talk about how <em>Inside Out</em> is structured as a story, so “Co-screenwriter” is going to have to do for now.</p>

<p>See, there’s something about the way <em>Inside Out</em> is constructed that is just so very Pixar. There is no fat on the film – everything is there for a reason, and story ideas that are planted early come to fruition in unexpected but wholly satisfying ways. The emotional crisis of a preteen girl named Riley – told mainly from within her own head where each emotion is a character running the human brain as a day job– is certainly an unexpected concept from a studio that has been focusing lately more on sequels and prequels. You helped create the original <em>Monsters Inc.</em> and the glorious <em>Up</em>, after all. I don’t think it’s in your nature to make something completely unoriginal. </p>

<p>A lot of care and thinking has been put into every moment we see on screen, not matter how small. You can feel the guiding hand of what Ed Catmull detailed in his book about Pixar’s creative process, <em>Creativity Inc.</em>: when a film is in development at Pixar, it is subjected to relentless group discussions where every aspect of it is scrutinized and questioned until what is left is hopefully the purest story possible. Every character, every beat, every turn in <em>Inside Out</em> has been scrutinized by Pixar’s core creative team, whether any of their names appear in the credits or not. Inside and out, <em>Inside Out</em> is every inch a Pixar film – and that’s what caused a bit of a crisis for me as a viewer. </p>

<p>More on that later – let’s look at everything else first.</p>

<p>Being a Pixar production doesn&#39;t just impact story development. Everything single thing on screen is meticulously devised. The production design and working details of Riley’s emotions are both beautiful and hilarious. You’ve spoken before about how much of an influence Hayao Miyazaki’s work has had on you as an artist, and the way you combine—and fully embrace—the everyday drama of life and absurd whimsy, without a need to completely reconcile the two. This makes you perhaps the most Miyazaki-like of Pixar’s directors. The characters that run Riley’s emotions—Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness—look almost fairy-like, with an oh-so-slight glowing shimmer that follows them (Anger’s head literally shoots flames, adding to the supernatural element). The world of Riley’s consciousness feels like a candy-colored version of the spirit world Miyazaki’s <em>Spirited Away</em>. It has its own social order, rules and characters that all have jobs to do and want things to work the way they’re supposed to because that’s how it’s always been. Like Miyazaki’s spirits, the last thing anyone needs is something upsetting the status quo.</p>

<p>Of all the characters running Riley’s brain, the one who most wants things to never change is Joy. Played with her unique combination of pluck, desperation and maddeningly cheerful aggression, Amy Poehler makes Joy the Leslie Knope of the id. She sees herself as the leader of the five emotions, and is set on making sure Riley’s daily life and memories have the least amount of possible stress. So of course when developing this story, Pete, you made sure that a series of accidents and good intentions gone wrong lead Joy to get tossed from her safe spot in HQ to the wilds of Riley’s subconscious with the one emotion she is least equipped to deal with: Sadness.</p>

<p>This brings me back to my point of crisis. You knew to do this from a story point of view because you’ve done it before: the two quarrelling characters that get tossed from the safety of their privileged position and need to make their way back through a series of obstacles is taken right from the <em>Toy Story</em> playbook (a playbook you also co-wrote). Joy’s constant exasperation with Sadness’s refusal to accept her place and stay out of Joy’s way has much in common with the Woody/Buzz Lightyear dynamic. Both characters here are funny and original—and Phyllis Smith’s voice work as Sadness is at least on par with Poehler’s—but we’ve seen this situation before.</p>

<p>Similarly, the “it’s just a job” take on the inner workings of the human psyche has a decidedly <em>Monsters Inc.</em> bent to it. As these familiar elements came to my mind while watching <em>Inside Out,</em> I questioned whether you and your team had taken the safe route on your journey, choosing the tried and true in place of the actually new. Worried that Pixar’s iterative, group-based story development could be so good at distilling out story impurities that what was left, while pure, was also becoming homogenized, that the personal quirks were being lost to group consensus.</p>

<p>But, put simply, that’s my problem to deal with, not <em>Inside Out</em>’s—I can’t judge a film for what I think might have been there. The only responsibility you and the entire production team have is to the film. If the film works (and it does), then whatever baggage I bring based on your or your studio’s previous works is mine and mine alone. And I think I can see why you wanted to make these familiar choices: you’ve anchored your entire story on the emotional breakdown of an 11-year old girl. That’s a bold choice for what is being sold as a fun night out with those goofy guys from Pixar. You use those familiar elements to pull off quite the balancing act: what Riley is experiencing with Joy and Sadness missing from her psyche is pretty heavy stuff, and probably not what a general audience will be expecting when they purchase their tickets. Emotional shutdown isn’t usually associated with a fun time at the movies, after all.</p>

<p>I’m not going to complain if you want to support a story this potentially upsetting (especially for those close in age to Riley, not to mention their parents) with elements that make us all feel a little more at ease, or let us know a steady hand is guiding us through the rough terrain. (I will, however, complain just a little bit about the various themed “lands”  in Riley’s brain that felt pre-designed to work in a new Disney attraction – I can already imagine lineups for the “Don’t Touch the Lava” obstacle course.)</p>

<p>When the familiar and the unexpected work in concert, they influence each other. As we invest more in Riley, we imbue every small moment, every reaction she can’t even explain to herself with a weight that most summer blockbusters can’t generate by threatening to destroy the entire planet Earth. And characters that seem introduced only to generate laughs become tragic figures when they realize the role they have to play in Riley’s mental development—a role that is as heartbreaking for their acceptance of it as it is in its inevitability. You had me so hooked on the familiar storytelling that I didn’t even realize how invested I was in Riley’s story – I had my own emotional reaction that I couldn’t explain. </p>

<p>At least not until I could sit back a bit and admire your craft from a distance.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><em>Dope</em> is as much a cultural artifact as it is a story. An artifact because it often only makes sense in relationship to the films that it depends on to first inform, and prop up, its central premise—movies like <em>Juice</em>, <em>Boys N’ The Hood</em> and especially <em>Menace II Society.</em></p>

<p>These movies all dealt with the limited number of choices that inner city youth face. In the 1990’s the cinematic response to this dearth of choices usually took the shape of nihilistic acceptance, or sometimes defiance followed quickly by tragic consequences. <em>Dope</em> tries to sketch a third option. Bur that new option only makes sense, in this case, when contrasted with what came before. This is not necessarily an ineffectual strategy, but it <em>does</em> depend upon a prior knowledge of the genre, which is a risky approach.</p>

<p><em>Dope</em> certainly begins with real promise. The main characters—a 90’s throwback nerd, a lesbian and a bro-y stick figure who all live in present day Inglewood CA.—aren’t types that conventionally populate the urban youth genre. Not to mention their single unifying principle—membership in the only new wave/thrash band in their zip code. It gave me hope that this might be a different take on an otherwise well-worn premise.</p>

<p>When this trio of high school kids becomes unwittingly embroiled in a drug transaction gone wrong is the moment when you make your first appearance (in this case as a knapsack full of MDMA) and also where the film goes a little off-track. Because McGuffins like yourself (as Hitchcock once described you—the <em>thing</em> that the spy’s are all concerned with but the audience doesn’t really care about) are only useful in very small doses.</p>

<p>In this case you trigger a convoluted narrative involving competing drug gangs, bit-coins, corrupt city officials and some pretty retrograde gender politics. This unnecessary baggage muddies what had begun as a pretty interesting—and sometimes funny—meditation on what it is like to be an outsider in a very specific set of circumstances.  </p>

<p>While <em>Dope</em> seems intent on repudiating the underlining despair present in the films that it structurally mimics, it often falls into the very tropes it wants to undermine. It is, in some significant ways, a prisoner to the kind of inexorable logic that made the earlier films so powerful. They were expressing what seemed to be an unanswerable dilemma for the young men at the center of these stories, and one that also seemed to lack a win/win option. Caine in <em>Menace II Society</em>, Bishop in <em>Juice</em>, Doughboy in <em>Boyz N’ The Hood</em> all end up dead, caught up in lives that are circumscribed by mostly terrible options.  </p>

<p>So when this film starts to lean more heavily on the standards of the genre, especially in the second and third act, those conventions tend to step on the more nuanced approach of the first act. Characters become much less three-dimensional as the story mechanics flatten them out. Plot starts to drive character and the film becomes less organic, more by the numbers.</p>

<p>But there is a lot to like here. Good central performances by a young cast, more than a few sharply observed moments that establish a strong sense of place, and a script that is ambitious and often surprising. Unfortunately, that promise fades away when you, Mr. McGuffin, take centre stage. </p>

<p>Certainly you’re useful as an entry point, a reason for the characters to engage and act. But when you become the focal point of the story, you’re revealed for what you are—a mechanism and nothing more. That kind of exposure means the rest of the film becomes an exercise of moving from a to b to c. </p>

<p>McGuffins, as is true of so many other aspects of cinema (like editing, or the soundtrack, or even the performances), are best when they go unnoticed. Sadly, in <em>Dope</em>, you draw far too much attention to yourself and what could have been a pretty good film is instead reduced to a self-defeating exercise.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You’re the most famous palaeontologist since Ross from <em>Friends</em>. Which is kind of sad because you’re <em>actually</em> a palaeontologist with years of study under your belt. Your behind-the-scenes presence in all the <em>Jurassic Park</em> releases has helped provide a realistic-ish portrayal of what would happen if humans faced off against dinosaurs. </p>

<p>I say realistic-<em>ish</em> because you yourself admitted that you had to curb your expertise for the sake of entertainment, which is admirable. It’s one thing to be a consultant about dinosaurs, but it’s another to consciously suppress your knowledge for the betterment of the movie. Although, you have to agree, velociraptors are scarier without the feathers. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong; your most recent project, <em>Jurassic World</em>, was entertaining as hell. It isn’t every day you get to see an alpha standoff between a genetically altered mega-dinosaur and a T-rex. My inner child pretty much passed out from excitement. </p>

<p>But as entertaining as it was, this showdown is part of the problem. <em>Jurassic World</em> strayed too far away from being a movie about dinosaurs to being a summer blockbuster about “monsters.” </p>

<p>Your input in the original trilogy was based on fact, but <em>Jurassic World</em> had a new twist involving humans tampering with gene-modification to create a new, enhanced species of dinosaur. The film shows us what would happen if that dinosaur was raised in captivity only to escape and wreak havoc on unsuspecting tourists in a prehistoric-themed amusement park (same thing happened when I played <em>Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs</em>). </p>

<p>It’s the type of ideal scenario for a classic Hollywood monster mash. When our mega dinosaur is loose in the forest and an elite team of soldiers goes in to contain it, the bloodbath that follows closely resembles something out of <em>Alien</em>: lots of screaming and people being flung around. What’s the best way to show this creature is a force to be reckoned with? Throw some collateral damage its way. </p>

<p>That type of arc opens doors for even more clichés, blatant and excessive foreshadowing, and inappropriate moments of comedy and romance that strip away realism and predictable character growth.</p>

<p>I for one enjoyed the minor details you helped provide: the velociraptors, using their hind legs to aggressively climb their prey (similar to hungry hyenas), or the rotting teeth that can be seen when our antagonist dino sniffs out Chris Pratt. I would have liked to see more of that. </p>

<p><em>Jurassic World</em> is definitely entertaining. It’s a summer blockbuster. I get that. And as far as summer blockbusters go, it hit the mark. I had fun watching it, as did my girlfriend (who was there for Chris Pratt). I laughed, felt tense, and even jumped out of my seat a couple of times. If this is the trend that any sequel will follow, I’d be okay with it. I just hope if you are to be attached again, that you’ll have more of a say with the how the movie pans out. </p>

<p>I’m sure the success of <em>Jurassic World</em> will help finance your goal to bring <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/paleontologist-jack-horner-is-hard-at-work-trying-to-turn-a-chicken-into-a-dinosaur/2014/11/10/cb35e46e-4e59-11e4-babe-e91da079cb8a_story.html">Chickenosaurus</a> to life.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/6/11/entourage</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Eight seasons and a movie. That’s a long run for any creative endeavour. Just keeping up the energy is a feat in and of itself—especially for something as fundamentally empty as <em>Entourage</em>. The Hollywood adventures of Vinnie Chase and his gang of charisma-free bros—brother and fellow actor Johnny Drama, his manager E, and driver Turtle (I’d name the actors, but let’s not pretend they’ll have any kind of career outside this)—felt like something that warranted three, maybe four seasons. It was always a trifle of a show, and the longer it went on it was obvious that there never was any <em>there</em> there. Nothing. At all. How could you keep returning to mine something that emptied its reserves so long ago?</p>

<p>What became clear to me while watching your movie version of <em>Entourage</em>, though, was that the eight season run is actually the key. In what I can only assume may be the first known instance of cinematic Stockholm Syndrome, at some point you stopped being any kind of observer of your subjects. Instead of viewing them objectively, you started to admire them. You wanted to be them; your own creations became your aspiration. That has to be it. It’s certainly the best way to explain why <em>Entourage</em> is as lazy—and as dumb—as its characters. It takes the easy way out of, well, everything.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I suppose, we do have a bit of a field guide for the lazy auteur.</p>

<p>For example, we finally have an answer to the age old problem of what to do when a writer needs his character to spout exposition, but can’t be bothered to make it in any way a natural part of dialogue: make them non-sequitors! It leads to awesome exchanges like this:</p>

<p>“It’s great Vinnie invited us to is yacht in Ibiza!”<br>
“Yeah. I can’t believe he split up with his wife on their honeymoon!”</p>

<p>Need to introduce a sort-of celebrity that may not be instantly recognizable with an audience whose head isn&#39;t up the ass of Hollywood? Just have Turtle and E engage in call-and-response until the relevant information has been explained in a way that would embarrass the author of an <em>I Can Read</em> book:</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, look!&quot;<br>
&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;<br>
&quot;It&#39;s Ronda Rousey!&quot;<br>
&quot;The MMA fighter?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah!&quot;</p>

<p>Okay, I get it. Writing is hard. And if anything, <em>Entourage</em> is and always was about things coming easy. I&#39;m not the first one to point this out to you, Doug, but <em>Entourage</em> may be the most conflict-free series to ever grace television and the big screen. HBO&#39;s comedy successors to your time slot, <em>Veep</em> and <em>Silicon Valley</em> both know that there&#39;s little—drama <em>or</em> comedy—in watching characters constantly win at life. </p>

<p>To be fair, Doug, you do seem to understand this on some basic level. In <em>Entourage</em>, you make the most token of gestures towards some sort of conflict: the supposed dramatic crux set up pre-credits is that Vinnie demands to direct the next movie in which he stars. I was willing to ride along; there’s something to be made from the proposal that Vinnie’s hubris will destroy his reputation and take his agent Ari down with him. But then the opening credit sequence concluded with the title “Eight months later.” You skipped over the entire production of the film to get back to … more parties, more luxury porn, and—worst of all—more bro-humour. Like the loathsome depiction of every female character in this movie, I guess I only have myself to blame for thinking things would be different this time.</p>

<p>It did let me watch <em>Entourage</em> in a different light, though. Instead of seeing it only as the not-funny, up-its-own-ass piece of misogynous dreck it most assuredly is, I could also see the self-reflecting prison you had built around yourself. When Vinnie asks Ari (Jeremy Piven, being the one reliable bright spot on the show, returning to erase any good will that remained for his character) for another 10 or so million dollars to finish the film, everyone worries that the movie is in trouble. Maybe it will reveal that, much like Adrienne Grenier, there’s absolutely nothing to Vinnie Chase. And then you go and make the biggest of bone-headed decisions: you show a scene from the actual movie.</p>

<p>That movie is some sort sci-fi reimagining of <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> called, naturally, <em>Hyde</em>. As Ari sits though a rough cut, terrified that he’s about to witness a megaflop, we are treated to <em>Hyde</em>’s opening credits: Vinnie dressed a hooded, kind of Jedi-Knight-cyborg-DJ overseeing what looks to be the rave scene from <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em>. For real. And the thing is, I couldn’t tell if I was supposed to read this as amazing or laughably ridiculous. Okay, I knew it was the latter, but I wasn’t sure what side everyone in <em>Entourage</em> was on.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Doug, you came to the rescue as always with your dialogue designed to explain the scene for all levels of learning impairments. “It’s a masterpiece!” “It’s the best thing he’s ever done!” “This will win at the Golden Globes!” I might have bought this just a little if you hadn’t shown me something that has all the artistic merit of a cut Uwe Boll scene. </p>

<p>When Ari steps up as the champion for <em>Hyde</em>, willing to risk everything to protect its vision, I’m fairly certain I’m not supposed to be siding with the <em>Entourage’s</em> villain, the investor’s son, who wants to reedit <em>Hyde</em> himself purely out of spite because Vinnie stole a girl from him. Anything he does can’t be worse than what we’ve already seen.</p>

<p>So I had a brief-but-actual dilemma: was I watching a movie made by people so blinded by their own reflection that they can no longer tell when they’ve crossed the line into self-parody? Or was I watching a satire <em>about</em> those very people that was so razor sharp, so pitch perfect, that maybe I was the one too dense to be in on the joke? Maybe there were some signifiers that I just didn’t get - maybe the possibility of winning a Golden Globe <em>is</em> supposed to come off as the joke we all know it is. And then I remembered, in perhaps the biggest irony of all, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/26/pain-gain.html">Michael Bay already made that movie</a>.</p>

<p>You actually believe what you’re shovelling.</p>
