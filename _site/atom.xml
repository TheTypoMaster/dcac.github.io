    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I would be lying if I said I didn’t see this coming. Your <em>Fantastic Four</em> has lived under a pall of doom (pun-intended) since its conception. And it has certainly fulfilled all that negative promise—not only is it tanking at the box office but it’s currently standing at 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. That failure, in turn, has engendered a lot of <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fantastic-four-blame-game-fox-814764">nasty finger pointing</a>. </p>

<p>On Thursday you went nuclear with this <a href="http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/josh-trank-disowns-fantastic-four-via-twitter-claims-studio-interference-322">tweet</a>, in essence disavowing the film. Whatever ended up on the screen, you wanted everyone to know that it wasn’t representative of the film you wanted to make. Since the release there have been a more than a few stories about how early and often the studio stuck its finger in your pie. 20th  Century Fox ostensibly scrapped three agreed upon action sequences as well as removing the final edit from your hands. So it may well be that this version of <em>Fantastic Four</em> isn’t really yours. </p>

<p>What is it then?</p>

<p>Mostly it’s an incoherent mess. The film manages to avoid anything resembling excitement in its meandering travels. The characters are wafer-thin, and the performances range from surprisingly muted (Miles Teller) to stilted (Kate Mara) to occasionally charming (Michael B. Jordan) to nearly invisible (Jamie Bell).</p>

<p>The plot is a Frankenstein’s monster: pieces of the foundational story grafted haphazardly onto whatever the studio decided to replace it with. It has no flow and makes no sense. Secondary plots appear and disappear like soap bubbles, and whatever motivates the characters seems as much a mystery to the actors portraying them as it does to the rest of us.</p>

<p>Visually this monstrosity bears no resemblance to your nuanced work on <em>Chronicle</em> (the surprise indie hit that got you this gig in the first place). Where <em>Chronicle</em> was a film that was made for twelve million that looked like it cost a hundred and twenty, <em>Fantastic Four</em>  looks like the reverse. It’s poorly lit, the staging is clunky, and the CGI would have been laughable in the first <em>Spawn</em> movie. </p>

<p>Part of the problem assessing this film lies in trying to figure out what parts are yours and which parts were reshot by the studio. Fully 1/3 of this film is studio reshoots and that is by 20th Century’s admission, which means it is probably closer to 1/2. The whole film is riddled with the kind of inconsistencies this sort of meddling produces. Just watch Kate Mara’s wig as it appears and then vanishes in the same scene. This occurs in at least two different sequences in the film.</p>

<p>There was a brief, promising moment midway through the film just after the titular four have returned from the mysterious Planet Zero. All four of them have been exposed to an unnamed radiation/goop that conferred (inexplicably, but by then I had given up hope anyway) different powers on each of them. </p>

<p>Here you managed to do something really interesting (I assume this was you since the ambiguous consequences of obtaining superpowers like these was the theme of <em>Chronicle</em>); I didn’t see it coming, but the transformation sequence was darkly effective. The physical changes each one of them suffers through are played as Cronenberg-esque body horror. It was absolutely chilling. If the rest of the film had operated anywhere close to that level, it would have been remarkable.</p>

<p>Whoever is ultimately to blame—and I tend to think there is more than enough to go around—what I am most concerned about is whether or not this whole experience has undermined your credibility (or simply eaten your soul) to point that you’re effectively finished as a filmmaker. </p>

<p>That would be a shame. If nothing else I hope (probably in vain) that the studios will understand the consequences of hedging their bets. If you hire an auteur, then give him enough rope to hang himself. Because the short leash doesn’t serve anyone’s interests.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/8/11/vacation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Your work transcends eras and demographics, so it’s fitting that you’re involved in the remake of an 80s classic near and dear to my heart. When I was six years-old, Devo was my favourite band. I loved to pogo along to “Freedom of Choice”, and today, as an adult, I love clever lyrics like, “Freedom of choice is what you’ve got / Freedom from choice is what you want.” You and your hazmat-suited, energy-domed bandmates wrote anti-establishment diatribes disguised as catchy, new-wave pop. </p>

<p>You’ve worked on everything from <em>Pee-Wee’s Playhouse</em> to <em>21 Jump Street</em> to just about every Wes Anderson film, and now the <em>Vacation</em> reboot. There is even talk that <a href="http://time.com/3556593/wes-anderson-mark-mothersbaugh-theme-park/">you and Wes Anderson are going to open up a theme park</a> of your own in your hometown of Akron, Ohio. Considering that the idea that spurned the creation of Devo was De-evolution - the regression of mankind and the subversion of the American way of life – I’m guessing your target demographic won’t be families like the Griswolds. </p>

<p>Like its 1983 predecessor, <em>Vacation</em> is an R-rated comedy. As a kid, I knew those “mature audiences only” warnings were tongue-in cheek. There is very little about the <em>Vacation</em> movies that could be considered mature, and that’s what made them so much fun. When I was 10, I related to the Griswold kids, Rusty and Audrey, who had to endure the hell of road-tripping with their lame parents. As adults, my husband and I ritually watch <em>Vacation</em> before we go on holiday. It’s a silly reminder that no matter how bad our trip might turn out, it won’t be <em>Griswold</em>-bad. I was worried that this new iteration might sour the franchise again (ahem, <em>Vegas Vacation)</em>, but it manages to hit the same absurd, juvenile, and hilariously uncomfortable marks as the original. And, like the 1983 version, this <em>Vacation</em> is better enjoyed as the sum of its parts rather than as a whole. </p>

<p>Rusty Griswold is now a husband and father who longs to bond with his kids and to reignite the passion in his marriage. But because he is a Griswold, his idea of a quick fix is to take the family on a road trip to Wally World. The film opens with Lindsay Buckingham’s “Holiday Road” and the titles roll over a montage of awkward family vacation photos, reassuring us that the elements we loved about the original film will be updated accordingly. “Holiday Road” is covered a few times (once as a dirge), but many of the songs you include are integral to the plot (“Kiss From A Rose” and “Summer Breeze”) while others are pitch perfect additions (“Crown on the Ground” and ”Still Not A Player”).</p>

<p>There are many elements that harken back to the original film. Popular comedians in bit parts, a dysfunctional vehicle, uncomfortable family reunions, and it all meshes well with this vision of the 21st-Century Griswolds. The kids – overly-sensitive teen James and his sociopathic little brother Kevin – have more to chew on than their counterparts. The parents, played by Ed Helms and Christina Applegate, naturally channel that lovably moronic Griswold sensibility. Applegate is given far more to do than Beverly D’Angelo ever was, and she steals almost every scene she’s in. As much as I love the long-suffering Ellen, Applegate’s “Do-Anything” Debbie is a refreshingly feminist, take-no-BS matriarch. </p>

<p>Watching last year’s Oscar telecast, I got super excited about seeing you onstage during the musical number for “Everything Is Awesome” (which you produced). The exact opposite of that Oscar-night excitement is what I felt near the end of <em>Vacation</em>’s second act, when Chevy Chase shows up, reprising his role as the bumbling Clark Griswold. His tired shtick evokes little more than pity-laughs from those of us old enough to remember when he was still funny. It’s easy to see why, during their blessedly brief cameo, D’Angelo looks like the proverbial deer in headlights. I guess three-plus decades of dealing with Chase’s shrinking talent and massive ego will do that to a person. I hope that this dutiful nod to the <em>pater familias</em> means that we won’t have to endure more awkward visits with Grandpa Clark should the franchise continue. Like Devo’s unnecessary 1984 cover of “R U Experienced?”, some things are better left in the past.</p>

<p>Nostalgia trips are fun up to a point, but they can quickly veer into self-indulgence. <em>Vacation</em> takes what we loved most about the original and drives it into this century. But it flails when it tries to preach about spending time with family and working hard to maintain your marriage. Sure, those things are important, but that’s not why we watch a <em>Vacation</em> movie. </p>

<p>The Griswolds just want to live the suburban dream of a picture-perfect family, secure job, and well-deserved annual holiday but they are thwarted at every turn. It seems they’ve embraced your theory of De-volution, but because they are Griswolds, they have done so completely by accident.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/8/8/southpaw</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The truly great boxers are possessed of a very specific set of skills. Marvin Hagler, Ray Leonard, Ezzard Charles, all of these men were blessed with a remarkable combination of speed and power as well as a dancer&#39;s elegance. So it was something of a surprise to see Jake Gyllenhaal exhibit that same kind of rare physicality in <em>Southpaw</em>. His performance, both in the ring and out, was mostly remarkable.</p>

<p>You also had all of those technical skills, Roy. The power, the quickness, the casually luminous athleticism that all exceptional athletes possess. But in the same way this film was potentially brilliant—it had a solid cast, beautiful cinematography, and a director who had previously produced superior work—your career and <em>Southpaw</em> share a sad confluence. In both cases all those ingredients never added up to more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>The script dutifully checks the appropriate boxes—riches to rags to redemption. Everyone from the deeply flawed trainer to the avaricious promoter had their requisite moment. Characters were definitely at the disposal of the plot, a circumstance that inevitably leads to a lack of emotional engagement with the audience. Rachel MacAdams was underutilized and she disappeared from the film far too quickly. There were any number of characters that simply show up as required. Disillusioned daughter—check. Kid from the wrong side of the tracks that echoes the protagonist as a troubled youth—check. At least the daughter doesn’t get eradicated, offstage, and then dismissed with a single sentence when her purpose has been served. These characters/plot devices appear and then, when convenient, do a quick fade. As a result of this kind of utilitarian construction, nothing about the script felt organic or even mildly surprising.</p>

<p>Gyllenhaal carried every moment he was on screen, which thankfully was most of the film. His portrayal of Billy ‘The Great White’ Hope was nuanced and, when the script allowed, riveting. Not only did he nail the physical aspects of the character but he painted a convincing portrait of how elite athletes are often congenitally ill equipped to deal with the mundane realities of daily life—that if they are stripped of their support structures they are often revealed for the literal babes in the woods that they are. It is Billy’s journey from child to something akin to a responsible adult that is the backbone of this movie, and that journey had moments of real pathos.</p>

<p>The boxing scenes were competently filmed and lucid in their construction. The climactic fight, particularly, was elegantly crafted, but somehow empty of any real emotion. And that is perhaps the problem with the film. Antoine Fuqua is a remarkably adept technical director. His films look beautiful, they generally move at a good clip and there is very little that could be labeled as extraneous. But it seems to be the case that the early promise of a film like <em>Training Day</em> owed as much to a great script by David Ayers and a brilliant performance from Denzel Washington as anything else. Nothing Fuqua has done since has come close to the spiky greatness of that superb film.</p>

<p><em>Southpaw</em> is a film that contained all the moving parts for something special but the conventional nature of the script and a seeming reluctance to step outside of any of the usual tropes hamstrung the whole enterprise. I’m not sure if that is the result of caution on Fuqua’s part or simply the weakness of the material but the film never managed to create the heightened emotional beats that similar films, like <em>Warrior</em> or <em>The Fighter,</em> evoked.  </p>

<p>As with the difference between a great fighter and merely a good one, a great film is possessed of an ineffable quality that a good film simply lacks. This quality is beyond technical prowess or even the talents of everyone involved. You know this better than most, Roy, partially because it was something that occasionally eluded you in your career. Your talent was superlative but you sometimes failed to rise to the moment—you seemed to lack the capacity to transcend your admittedly infrequent limitations. <em>Southpaw</em> also never quite manages that transcendent quality either; and as a result is, in its best moments, just a good film.</p>

<p>But not a great one.</p>

    <updated>2015-08-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>/content/2015/8/1/amy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>This is the verbatim conversation <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/writers/timm/">Tim McEown</a> and I had on July 23, 2011:</p>

<p>Me: Amy Winehouse died.</p>

<p>Tim: How?</p>

<p>Me: Rescuing kittens from a burning building. How do you think?</p>

<p>Tim: Wouldn’t that have been awesome though? Then she’d be remembered as a hero.</p>

<p>Me: Instead of a cliché.</p>

<p>Yes, that was cold. But, to be fair, no one was surprised by the death of Amy Winehouse. She was a brilliant young singer/songwriter blessed with a soulful voice—and it just so happened that her immense talents were matched by her inner demons. It’s a story as old as pop music itself: a troubled singer becomes an overnight sensation, can’t handle the pressure, and succumbs to drugs, alcohol, unhealthy relationships, and eventually dies too young. </p>

<p>We’ve seen the scenario played out so many times –  Jimi, Janis, Jim, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/5/13/kurt-cobain-montage-of-heck.html">Kurt</a>, etc.– that it’s almost impossible to feel much more than a passing, “damn, what a waste”, before clicking on to the next story. In his documentary, <em>Amy</em>, director Asif Kapadia manages to strip away the layers of what the public knew of Amy Winehouse – the bruises, the streaked makeup, the slurring hot mess – to show a sweet, witty, and remarkably self-aware woman. </p>

<p>Kapadia amassed an exhausting amount of footage – candid home movies, interviews, live performances – and opens his film in 1998. A 14 year-old Amy sings “Happy Birthday” while twirling a lollipop. Her gift is undeniable. Kapadia manipulates the footage, zooming in, slowing it down, and show us how she grew into such a confident performer. We see her notebooks and watch her lyrics appear in cursive while she sings them. The interviews with her friends, family, bodyguards, managers, and ex are all audio tracks, which keeps the focus entirely on Amy. Kapadia’s approach is fully aware of the irony behind the camera’s fascination with her, and how it became an instrument of both her rise and fall.</p>

<p>And while we’re on the subject of irony, “Rehab”:..</p>

<p>You were Amy’s biggest hit. But you were also the albatross around her neck. A catchy, Phil Spector-inspired chastisement to the doubters in her life, you skyrocketed her to fame with a cheeky hook that in retrospect seems like a cry for help. “They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no, no, no.” Amy sings you in one of the film’s best montages: on Leno, on Letterman, on increasingly larger stages, on the car radio in New York City. This could have been the sappy <em>VH1 Behind the</em> <em>Music</em>-style crescendo, the rising star sequence that leads to the overwrought “and then the unthinkable happened”-moment. But Kapadia doesn’t go there. As he did so masterfully in his documentary about Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, Kapadia manages the feat of actually making us forget, at least momentarily, that Amy (and Senna) died. </p>

<p>Externally, the Paparazzi pursued Amy relentlessly, stalking her at literally every turn. Internally, she faced constant pressure to keep performing despite her health being at risk from both addiction and years of bulimia. After nearly OD-ing, Amy and her husband Blake’s Sid &amp; Nancy-like desire to come off drugs together highlights how co-dependent they were. At one point during a tenuous attempt at recovery, Blake teasingly goads her to change your lyrics, and she responds, weakly: “I don’t really mind it here.” </p>

<p>Later, it becomes clear that your lyrics, “I ain’t got the time, and if my daddy thinks I’m fine,” aren’t just brassy pop sentiment—Mitch, her dad, goes so far as to stalk her for his own documentary, bringing a TV crew to St. Lucia where she has been trying to clean up. It becomes increasingly uncomfortable to watch Amy struggle to please everyone but herself.</p>

<p>These scenes, and those of her barely able to remember your lyrics while swaying onstage, are stomach churning. Because by now we’ve seen the <em>real</em> Amy. The one who was devilishly funny and wise beyond her years. The one who loved her friends and family. The one who loved making music, and the one who was frightened of becoming famous because she knew what it would do to her. </p>

<p>Kapadia shows us the Amy behind the trainwreck tabloid escapades. She becomes someone we want to root for. And not just because of her million dollar pipes. <em>Amy</em> is gutting because it <em>isn’t</em> the story of yet another star gone too soon; her struggle with mental illness and recovery was very real, and no less difficult because of her celebrity. Addiction doesn’t care if you’re famous.  </p>

<p>You were Amy’s biggest song but you certainly weren’t her best. Still, you will live on, mostly as a macabre joke sung by a reluctant pop star. But <em>Amy</em> reminds us that Amy wasn’t a punchline. She was a person.</p>

    <title>The Value of a Veteran Filmmaker</title>

    <id>/content/2015/7/22/the-value-of-a-veteran-filmmaker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It is interesting, and a little alarming, that so many sophomore directors are being handed projects with potentially studio-destroying budgets. Marc Webb with the Andrew Garfield <em>Spider-Man</em>, Colin Trevorrow with <em>Jurassic World</em>, Josh Trank with <em>Fantastic Four</em>  (and, until recently, an iteration of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise). Last year it was Gareth Edwards with <em>Godzilla</em>, this year it is Jon Watts and the Spider-Man reboot—Watts is, incidentally, a director whose first feature <em>hasn’t</em> <em>actually been</em> <em>in wide release</em> _yet. </p>

<p>While directing seems to be one of those professions that is only perfected through doing, what doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense is the immediate jump from zero funded indie to budgets that are the GNP’s of some countries. When even someone as savvy and experienced as Joss Whedon (although <em>The Avengers</em> really was just his second feature film) can be turned out because of the kind of terrible shearing pressure that these films can generate, it seems a awful lot to expect first-or-second timers to negotiate. Josh Trank, whose indie <em>Chronicle</em> (12 million dollar budget) led directly to <em>The</em> <em>Fantastic</em> <em>Four</em> (budget 122 million) just recently lost the <em>Star Wars</em> gig, at least partially, because of erratic behavior on the set of <em>FF.</em> </p>

<p>If it were only a question of money, or even logistics, perhaps a lack of practical experience would be less of an issue, but the pressures involved in these sorts of enterprises come from every angle imaginable. Anyone without a fair amount of experience, both as a director and just as a human, is likely to be pulled apart. (For an example of how badly this can go I would point everyone to the documentary <em>Overnight.</em> Troy Duffy was the writer/director of <em>Boondock Saints</em> and is the poster boy for the worst-case scenario in this instance.)</p>

<p>These budgets not only represent a huge investment on the part of the studio but they also come with any number of peripheral expectations: to serve the fan base, to meet unrealistic first weekend goals, to manage the inevitable, and often contradictory, demands that come with promotional budgets that often are as large as the production budgets. Sometimes these films even represent investments significant enough to topple whole studio—forget what a flop might do to the individuals involved. There are probably very few twenty-six year olds equipped to manage any one of these concerns, much less all of them.</p>

<p>Less important whether any particular film works, though, is what this approach may be doing to a whole generation of up and coming filmmakers. Not so long ago it was possible to build a body of work that allowed for a gradual maturing of the creative process. Directors like Scorsese, Cuarón, The Coen Bros., Kathryn Bigelow or even Guillermo Del Toro were initially involved in low budget, low stakes (at least in a fiscal sense) filmmaking. Films like <em>Mean Streets, , Near Dark, Sólo Con Tu Pareja, El Espinazo del Diablo, Blood Simple,</em> were, most importantly, all steps along a longer creative path and not just an audition for a place at the summer tentpole trough.</p>

<p>What that meant was the filmmakers in question could afford a mistake or two and it wouldn’t cost the studio millions of dollars, people their careers or even risk ending up being the punch line in a terrible joke. Q: What cost 200 million dollars and has four arms. A: <em>John Carter.</em> And let’s face it, you don’t hear Andrew Stanton being bandied about as the next big thing—but this was a guy, just three years ago, who was being touted as another Brad Bird.</p>

<p>Probably the best example I can give of the potential cost of all of this is not the most obvious one. If you compare <em>Jurassic World</em> to <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> (at least in the most reductive way possible) you might say one was a moderate success while the other was an unprecedented accomplishment. But if you watch all the interviews and other media that led up to both releases, only one of the two directors looked like they had just finished crossing the ocean in an open boat,while fighting off sharks the whole way. And it wasn’t the seventy year-old who had spent six months in the desert with a pissed off Tom Hardy.</p>

<p>Colin Trevorrow looks and sounds like he has a bad case of PTSD, and implicit in almost all his interviews is a kind of weariness that seems almost tragic. This is person whose first film, <em>Safety Not Guaranteed,</em> was a charming, low budget indie. His next film was <em>Jurassic World</em>, now one of the highest grossing films ever made. Trevorrow himself lamented his fate, in an article from Indiewire on July 7th  2015 <strong>“[Spielberg] had the privilege of being able to make a long series of original films—‘Sugarland Express,’ ‘Duel,’ and then ‘Jaws’—and from there, built up to something the size of [the ‘Jurassic Park’ franchise]. And in a certain way, I felt like I was being robbed of that right of a filmmaker to make a bunch of mistakes and learn from those mistakes.”</strong></p>

<p>Of course most directors will jump at the chance to helm one of these films. People who choose that profession often personify the term hubris (although notably, Ava DuVernay has turned down <em>Black Panther</em>, specifically citing her desire to continue developing her own voice—so it is not always the case). Certainly it is ridiculous to expect the studios not to continue along this path as long as the success rate is over a certain percentage.</p>

<p>Perhaps the question is this: what is the cost of our collective, and seemingly never ending, desire for more and bigger and faster? There is a huge amount of social media pressure being exerted on the studios to produce whole slews of the kind of shared world films that the Marvel and DC universes represent. Perhaps in our desire to see these films created we have lost sight of some of the costs involved. </p>

<p>It is worth wondering, at least, what these individuals might have done were they not so quickly subsumed into the machine, if they had to eke out their own path in the wilderness for a little while longer. </p>

<p>After all, can you really have a <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> without first having taken the long trip Beyond Thunderdome?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Thank you for taking a chance. </p>

<p><em>Trainwreck</em> is a rom-com that turns the genre on its head. But it’s still about as rom-commy as a rom-com can get. And that’s okay, because this movie isn’t <em>just</em> a rom-com (I enjoy saying ‘rom-com’), it’s a stance. A stance in the face of Hollywood. It says that we are willing and ready to invest in a film with two leads that weren’t manufactured in the gorgeous celebrity factory. </p>

<p>Amy Schumer plays an anti-commitment, single woman living in New York. She’s self-aware; she realizes that she doesn’t need to be a size 0 to be sexy (despite what studio <a href="http://www.takepart.com/video/2015/03/09/amy-schumer-asked-to-starve-for-trainwreck">execs</a> had to say). She’s confident in her interactions with men, until she meets Aaron, an up and coming sports doctor who is persistent in his pursuit.</p>

<p>When Amy Schumer developed the script for <em>Trainwreck</em>, she was expecting a plastic princess to take the lead, but to her surprise, the Hollywood big wigs wanted her as the titular character. This is where you could have come in and decided to cast a Matt Bomer or Charlie Hunnam to play her love interest. I’m so happy that you didn’t. You went with Bill Hader, a man best known for mimicking a tauntaun and playing a metrosexual travel expert with a fetish for fetish clubs. </p>

<p>How refreshing!</p>

<p>Amy Schumer has made a living by being a normal human being and pointing out how horrible the media is—but casting an “average” girl isn’t anything new in Tinseltown. They’ve been slapping ponytails and fake glasses on hot women for years. No, the real risk you took was also adding Bill Hader to the mix. This is the first time in his career that he’s been cast as a love interest. </p>

<p>Your against-the-norm casting is part of what makes <em>Trainwreck</em> so enjoyable. The film is jam-packed with celebrity cameos (Daniel Radcliffe, Amar’e Stoudemire, Lebron James), any number of whom are considered sex symbols, but they were all fillers. The real attraction is between the slightly awkward, pizza-loving Amy Schumer and the stiff, nerdy Bill Hader. </p>

<p>Kudos on your peculiar but successful casting of Lebron James as the penny-pinching, emotional best friend and John Cena as the sensitive, closeted homosexual. Choosing athletes in the prime of their career and having them do a complete 180 was not only a pleasant surprise, but also a key element in making <em>Trainwreck</em> hilarious.</p>

<p>Given the <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/7/4/terminator-genysis.html">importance</a> of proper casting in highly anticipated movies, your strategic mixing and matching enhances the overall experience and ensures <em>Trainwreck</em> will be a sought after addition to the W network’s primetime slot for years to come.</p>

<p>With Bill Hader and Amy Schumer hogging the spotlight in this movie -- and Ike Barinholtz appearing as the love interest to Amy Poehler in the upcoming comedy, <em>Sisters</em> -- our traditional rom-com heavyweights might soon be out of a job. Can anyone spare a dime for a smoulder?</p>

<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

<p>Ankit</p>

    <id>/content/2015/7/16/big-game</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I didn’t like your movie <em>Big Game</em> very much, but my real argument with you is less about the quality of your particular film and more to do with a larger issue.</p>

<p>First though, here’s why I didn’t enjoy <em>Big Game</em> specifically. The film is poorly written, unimaginatively shot, the performances are flat and uninteresting, and while you got Sam Jackson for the lead, Kyle MacLachlan could have easily replaced him and no one would have noticed, the part was so one dimensional. Still, much of that can be forgiven if the film is innovative or even just energetic, but <em>Big Game</em> is the worst of all possible things an action movie can be—it is irredeemably dull. My god, it is dull. Like sitting-on-the-bus-head–nodding-wondering–if- you-were-drooling-dull.</p>

<p>My real complaint has to do with something less concrete, but perhaps in the long run more important. While it is impossible, or maybe just pointless, to try and make qualitative distinctions about capital A art—is Picasso’s <em>Guernica</em> in some way better than Da Vinci’s <em>Mona Lisa</em>—it is entirely possible to make those kind of distinctions about entertainments. Every artist may be a thief, but if you are stealing sub standard material to begin with then the whole project can’t help but suck. It is here that I really have a bone to pick with you. </p>

<p>I have a hard time understanding why some people fetishize certain films from certain eras. There is, in particular, a tendency to point to the late eighties and into the nineties as some golden age for action films. Films like John McTiernan’s <em>Die Hard</em> (1988) or his <em>Predator</em> (1987) are just two examples that people often talk about in bafflingly reverent terms. In your case it is hard not to cite Wolfgang Peterson’s <em>Air Force One or 1993’s _The Fugitive as obviously carrying some weight with you, since these films so clearly influence _Big Game.</em></p>

<p>All of these were just fine as straightforward entertainments, fun to watch, kitschy in a good way, but for the most part they suffer in comparison to the best stuff being made now. There is a simple reason for that. Since they were hardly transcendent entertainments at the time, they will always suffer with age. They won’t look as good, the stunts aren’t as impressive, the camera work is constrained by technical concerns and the filmmaker’s imagination is circumscribed by what it is possible to actually show onscreen. </p>

<p>While the very best entertainments seem visually timeless (<em>Blade Runner</em> is perhaps the best example of that truth) they were, and still remain, superior in terms of performance, themes and creative execution—the imagination informing the story makes it onto the screen. So regardless of the advances in the technical aspects of filmmaking—CGI, smaller cameras, better and more dangerous stunt work—films like <em>Alien</em> and <em>Raider’s of The Lost Ark</em> still stand head and shoulders above most. This is because the more abstract facets of the craft—performance, direction, art direction, storytelling, editing—don’t suffer as much with age.</p>

<p>But when you set out to make a b-film, a straight up actioner without any pretensions, I can’t imagine why you would go the way you did, Jalmari. Instead of taking advantage of all the latest technical innovations and possibilities inherent in them, you went the other way. Instead of <em>The Raid: Redemption</em> you made some pale echo of <em>Patriot Games</em>. </p>

<p>Here is my entirely unsolicited advice. Don’t waste your budget on Sam Jackson if you aren’t going to use him properly. Instead, invest in some go-pro’s and some stunt work and make use of that unbelievable Finnish landscape. Tell me a mildly interesting story instead of this stupid, derivative crap that parrots stuff that wasn’t that good in the first place.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/7/8/a-conversation-with-director-jalmari-helander</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Finnish director Jalmari Helander is breaking into the Hollywood game with a new actioner starring Samuel Jackson – <em>Big Game</em>. We talk about his breakout success film <em>Rare Exports</em>, what’s wrong with most action movies today, and who he wants to make the next big action star. </p>

<p><strong>Let’s start by talking about <em>Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010)</em>. The movie quickly became a cult classic, at least here in Canada. What was your goal in creating that film?</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t have any kinds of goals. I tried to survive the whole thing and get the movie done. That was my goal. I also had a goal to make a different kind of Finnish movie, because in Finland all the movies are really boring, and I wanted to do something else and I’m really glad it worked out.</p>

<p><strong>What were some of the things you learned when you were making that movie?</strong> </p>

<p>Well of course I learned quite a lot. It was my first feature film. I have to say that the biggest lesson I learned was that if something doesn’t work in the script it will not work when we’re shooting it, and it will give you nightmares. You have to solve that problem when you are writing, it’s not going to solve itself later on. That’s my biggest lesson ever.</p>

<p><strong>Were there things about that film that you felt didn’t work? Or that you wish you could go back and change?</strong></p>

<p>Of course, but I actually watched <em>Rare Exports</em> two weeks ago, and I hadn’t seen it for many years, and now those problems didn’t bother me anymore. It’s weird. It somehow has evolved into a better film.</p>

<p><strong>Would you ever think of doing a remake where Santa Claus is really Canadian? Because we’re closer to the North Pole and our national colours are red and white…</strong></p>

<p>Well I’ve been asked to do a remake from Hollywood, but I think that would be a really big mistake. And try to imagine if you were to do that, and you get all the resources you ever wanted, and have the same story but in a bigger way, and in the end you realize something is missing, like, where is the original magic that was in the original film? That would be so terrible that I could never do that. Because it might happen, and you can never tell where it comes from. Whether it works or not.</p>

<p><strong>Your new film, <em>Big Game</em>, is about a boy who needs to prove that he’s a man by killing a big animal. Did you feel like there was a parallel there for you as a writer to prove yourself to Hollywood by shooting this big American-style action movie?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is this idea of...it’s almost like when I was a kid and I always said I was going to make a big action film and everyone always said to me that it’s a stupid dream and it’s never going to happen, and trying to get me to realize how unlikely that is to happen. But I somehow managed to get my dreams to reality and it makes me feel good. And I like that kind of underdog stories where no one believes you are going to do something really amazing. It’s always nice in a movie, and in real life.</p>

<p><strong>What about the fantasy you sort of created in the film about saving an American president. Is this a typical fantasy for a young Finnish boy?</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) I don’t think so. It just happened. We had a crazy idea with the producer and we just went with it.</p>

<p><strong>I’m sure you’re a fan of Hollywood films, but what would you say is the worst habit of Hollywood action films today?</strong></p>

<p>I think there are a lot of action films nowadays that are missing some kind of heart, or warmness. I think in the 80s or early 90s, when I was a really big action film fan, and would always go many times to see the same movie, there’s something different from what Hollywood is making now. I don’t know how to explain but something is missing.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to make a truly Hollywood film, who is one movie star you would both love to work with?</strong></p>

<p>I’m a big fan of Chris Pratt at the moment, which I think quite a lot of people are. If you look at something like <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, I think a lot of what made it a good movie was Chris Pratt, if you ask me. I think he’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>So <em>Big Game</em> sort of brings the American president to Finland, and I’m just wondering; is there a Finnish story that you would like to bring to America?</strong> </p>

<p>A lot of Finnish folklore are so dark, I don’t think it would be a big success. I already did Santa Claus which I think is a Finnish thing, although you think it’s a Canadian thing, so that’s one folklore I already did. I’m writing the next one so let’s see what happens.</p>

<p><strong>Finally – is there somebody on set, like a crew member, who really just does an incredible job and you would want to bring with you on any film you ever made?</strong></p>

<p>Somebody who was super great was Kiante Elan who was the stunt guy for Samuel Jackson. He also does the stunts for Will Smith, and he was one of the nicest people I have ever met. Always in a really, really good mood, and he doesn’t have a problem with anything and he’s super talented at what he does. He’s super great</p>

<p><strong>Do you kind of see yourself doing what Quentin Tarantino did or Keanu Reeves did where they turn a stunt person into a star of one of their films? Could you ever see him being a star in one of your films?</strong></p>

<p>I definitely could see. And I think he’s done some acting also, not anything really big but definitely, yes.</p>

    <title>Terminator: Genysis</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It would be unfair to place the responsibility for the fiasco that is <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> entirely at your feet. It’s a film whose shortcomings are so varied, so composite, that they defy easy categorization. The special effects are degenerative—somehow less thrilling, less real, than they were twenty-three (!) years ago in <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day.</em> The script unfolds like something the producers acquired through Fiverr—it has all the nuance and surprise of a crowdsourced piece of fan fiction. The production feels small-scale, constrained, cheap. Even the music – which occasionally pays tribute to Brad Feidel’s clamorous carillon theme – is so vacuous and forgettable that the film may as well have been scored by radio static. </p>

<p>All of this contributes to the feeling that <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> is nothing more than a great big B-movie (and not in the efficient, self-aware manner that that first <em>Terminator</em> was a B-movie). And what really solidifies the film’s lack of ambition is that you, Ronna, <em>cast</em> it like a B-movie. Amongst all its deficiencies, this is the most grievous: the lifelessness and lack of charisma that the actors bring to the screen. It’s almost impossible to comprehend. </p>

<p>Impossible, because there are Oscar-winners among the cast. And some terrific veteran character actors. Yet, together, they form a sort of tepid mass of humanity that doesn’t inspire even the smallest bit of affection (with one important exception, which, though obvious, I’ll wait to explain). </p>

<p>Yes, Emilia Clarke looks a bit like Linda Hamilton, and on <em>Game of Thrones</em> is able to conjure a matronly aura. But here she is doing a mere impression of being matronly, stuck somewhere between the Sarah Connor of the first film – a perpetually terrified damsel in distress – and the Sarah Connor of the second, all sinewy muscle and desperate authority. Clarke just doesn’t have the presence or the range to pull it off. </p>

<p>Jason Clarke, on the other hand, possesses...something. At least everyone who saw <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> seems to think so. But when he’s given more than ten minutes of screen-time, his <em>something</em> is proven to be a finite resource. In <em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em>, he was overshadowed not just by the troupe of CGI monkeys, but by virtually every other human performer as well. Here, as John Connor, the inspiring military leader who saves the human race, he inspires little more than indifference.</p>

<p>But the real centerpiece of this bromidic cast is Jai Courtenay, who now boasts a perfect two-for-two record in <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html">ruining beloved action franchises</a>.</p>

<p>I will admit that Michael Biehn, who originated the role of Kyle Reese, is no Laurence Olivier. Still, there was something in the intense sincerity with which he delivered every line, that made him seem like he came from the future, like he really was sent back on a dangerous mission. He delivered every line like it was a matter of life and death. </p>

<p>Courtney delivers his lines like he <em>is</em> dead. To say that he has no presence is inaccurate. He is a void. Like a black hole, he swallows the charisma of every orbiting body. He simply doesn’t seem to occupy quantum space as we know it. He is a man-shaped nothingness. There might as well be a square-jawed, bro-shaped hole in the movie screen; revealing, behind him, all the pulleys that control the curtain, all the wiring for the surround-sound speakers. His reaction when Sarah Connor tells him the story of her parents’ death (“The cabin blew up!”) is the stuff that Internet memes are made from; if you’ve ever wanted to see what a man’s face looks like when he’s conscious of how his eyebrows are moving, just watch that scene.  </p>

<p>But this isn’t some sprawling Robert Altman film. What do all these peripheral folks matter
? You see <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/6/12/jurassic-world.html">Jurassic Park movies</a> for the dinosaurs, and you see Terminator movies for the Terminators. And, yes, there at the center of it all is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, as he has aged, as his hair has greyed and delts have deflated, has somehow managed to become even more charismatic. </p>

<p>And that’s the miraculous thing about this fifth Terminator flick: that a franchise founded on the very inhuman blankness of it’s titular character could turn its blank, inhuman antagonist/protagonist into a complicated, evolving, sympathetic character. But it’s also the disappointing thing. Because this isn’t one of those sequels to a sequel to a sequel that has nothing new to offer the convoluted mythology. <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> introduces the very compelling idea of an aging Terminator confronting its obsolescence (“old, but not obsolete,” the T-800 keeps insisting), and Arnie brings that idea to life with a rather remarkable performance (every single ounce of charm this movie possesses is his). But the film is too busy trying to hit every action flick beat (specifically, every action flick <em>cliché</em>) to give that part of the story the attention is deserves. </p>

<p>So what are we left with? A series of inane expository conversations occasionally interrupted by some of the most unexciting, unimaginative action sequences in recent film history. Which wouldn’t be so interminable if the actors in the middle of those sequences had more charm than the cars and trucks and helicopters that were blowing up.</p>

<p>All it takes to elevate second-rate material is to put a magnetic presence in the middle of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger knows this. He’s built an entire career on it. It’s a shame you chose to surround him with such a deadly-dull gang of supporting players.</p>
