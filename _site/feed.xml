				<title>Insurgent</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In the pantheon of film tropes, a female character cutting off all of her hair is lazy shorthand for internal transformation. Either she’s survived a traumatic event and chopping off her locks symbolizes her emotional turmoil, or she’s making a bold statement by eschewing the trappings of mainstream femininity. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Insurgent’&lt;/em&gt;s protagonist, Triss, it’s a bit of both. After her radical coming of age, the &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt; series seemed poised to emulate the level of dystopian cultural gravitas that the &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; series brings to its films. But you and &lt;em&gt;Insurgent&lt;/em&gt; made me realize what snazzy new haircuts and middling middle films have in common: both are expensive and fussy and, though initially exciting, fall flat if they aren’t shaped properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping into the middle of a second film in a series feels a little like overhearing gossip about strangers at a busy hair salon: it’s momentarily entertaining, yet ultimately inconsequential. Following a coup, &lt;em&gt;Insurgent&lt;/em&gt; finds Triss and her boyfriend, Four, on the run from Jeanine, head of the Erudite faction. Intent on defeating Jeanine and restoring order to their world, Triss, Four, and the remaining Dauntless faction must join forces with the Factionless, led by Four’s estranged mother, Evelyn. In order to maintain complete control over the factions (Erudite, Candor, Abnegation, Amity, and Dauntless), Jeanine needs Triss, the most powerful Divergent—and also the only person who can open a box containing a message from the elders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were quite the hot topic on the way to the theatre. My 16 year-old niece was rather irked that you were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as the YA novel describes, cut just below the ear. Instead you were shorn into a short pixie-cut. This kind of detail matters to the teen girl readership (which is the same demographic that melted over the teens-with-cancer weeper &lt;em&gt;The Fault In Our Stars,&lt;/em&gt; the film adaptation also starring Woodley and the reason for your cut in the first place). Having not read the books, I was irked by &lt;em&gt;Insurgent’&lt;/em&gt;s inability to advance the characters beyond the people we left at the end of &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt; by even a hair’s breadth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, the film is detail-heavy. Especially with regards to the special effects, which are elaborate and mesmerizing. Triss must undergo trance-like simulations that require her to rescue her mother from a burning house hurtling through dystopian Chicago. In another, she must fight a version of herself. These sequences and others render objects and people into flying fragments; pixels disintegrate in slow motion and particles dissolving before Triss’ eyes. The film is fascinating to watch—but only when it’s not exhausting. The obvious plot twists and relentless exposition left me yearning for characters I could root for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film industry has done much hair-pulling recently over &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2015/film/news/women-lead-roles-in-movies-study-hunger-games-gone-girl-1201429016/&quot;&gt;the dearth of roles for women&lt;/a&gt;, especially those of a certain age. In this regard, &lt;em&gt;Insurgent&lt;/em&gt; is a cut above. Though their characters don’t exactly jump off the page, Octavia Spencer, Ashley Judd, Naomi Watts, and Kate Winslet succeed in elevating this installment beyond its weary premise. No doubt any one of them would have killed for a lead in this series had it been conceived twenty years ago, happily shearing off their locks for the chance to portray a strong female protagonist in a lucrative franchise. Like the formidable actresses that surround her, Woodley definitely has the chops to survive in this industry. She, along with the rest of the cast, are the only thing that keeps this overblown ‘do from delving into the territory of SyFy Channel original programming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had my share of drastic long-to-short haircuts (out of boredom; I’m not a movie character). One thing is certain, once the stylist has made that first cut: you have no choice but to commit. &lt;em&gt;Insurgent&lt;/em&gt; is the halfway mark of a series, and, despite the dazzle, it failed to deliver the excitement or intensity that the first film (however naïve) promised. Let’s hope that both you and the series find a way to transition out of that awkward “in-between” phase.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember, it could have been worse. Triss could have gotten a perm.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Gunman</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My reaction at the end of &lt;em&gt;The Gunman&lt;/em&gt; was pretty simple… WTF did I just watch?  Try to imagine a flaccid remake of John Frankenheimer’s &lt;em&gt;Ronin—&lt;/em&gt; but without the car chases. Then also imagine the occasional incoherent stab at exposing corporate malfeasance and geopolitical manipulation. If you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; imagine all of that then you are about halfway to recreating the experience of watching &lt;em&gt;The Gunman&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a sliding scale of expectation when it comes to evaluating a film like this. Going into &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/content/2015/1/12/taken-3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taken3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a while back, I made sure I had some help to make it through the screening—mostly because I was pretty sure it was going to be awful. On the other hand, the run up to &lt;em&gt;The Gunman&lt;/em&gt; had completely seduced me by massaging my action movie sweet spots. The trailers were marvels of efficient editing. It is also a great cast: Javier Bardem, Idris Elba, and Sean Penn moving through beautiful locales like Barcelona, London, and the Ivory Coast. Finally, I had heard Sean Penn doing some interviews and he actually sounded mildly enthused about the project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how could it go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to start? The direction is incredibly ham-fisted, once it steps outside of the mayhem. And even then, when an awkward metaphor involving bull fighting and the potential demise of Penn’s ‘gunman’ character is introduced, the purity of an otherwise perfectly competent sequence is ruined. There is also—I kid you not—a sequence where the male and female leads rush towards one another and embrace after a perilous separation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That really happened. It wasn’t played for laughs. Or even a snicker. Although it sure received one in the theatre where I was sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem of all was Sean Penn. I had once believed there was something authentic about his performances but I’m beginning to see how it was mostly an extension of his Hemingway-esque posturing in the real world. There really isn’t much there, even in the quiet, perfectly lit moments of broody angst. It just doesn’t scan. And dude, you are in great shape for a man your age but keep your fucking shirt on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn’s character is ostensibly the moral center of the film, but &lt;em&gt;The Gunman&lt;/em&gt; wants it both ways; he is alternately a brutally efficient killing machine and a remorseful NGO aid worker—without any of the psychological complexity necessary to square that particular circle. He comes off as a reluctant psycho-killer whose Doctor Without Borders lover cannot resist, despite her full knowledge of his various war crimes. The whole relationship seems as contrived and ad hoc as the rest of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my fellow movie traveler, don’t make the same sacrifice of time—and neurons—that I did.  Stay home and watch Robert De Niro and Sean Bean drive really fast cars through the French countryside. And know I have suffered for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it mean something, Private Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Will a Female Comedian Ever Be a Movie Star?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime around the year 2000, I had a sad epiphany. While talking movies with some friends, I realized there was no female equivalent to the big comedy stars of the day: Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, etc. The only counterexample we could think of was Cameron Diaz. But other than &lt;em&gt;There’s Something About Mary,&lt;/em&gt; there wasn’t much to base that argument on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I had no answer as to why a woman hadn’t broken through with the same success as so many men. But I figured it was only a matter of time. A new century was upon us, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to last weekend: another epiphany. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently three sitcoms  in my weekly must-watch TV schedule: &lt;em&gt;Girls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&lt;/em&gt;. Three shows that don’t just feature female leads, but each boast deep rosters of hilarious female characters and creators. And this is on top of other shows chalk full of great female leads like &lt;em&gt;Veep&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mindy Project&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Rec,&lt;/em&gt; and easily a dozen others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I tried to think of equivalent female &lt;em&gt;movie&lt;/em&gt; stars. Women who are performing in comedy films with the same success as their small-screen counterparts. Needless to say, I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What gives? Why is it that television has long been, and is now (perhaps more than ever) filled with funny female actors and rich characters, while female film stars are always one-and-done when it comes to big comedy successes? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first instinct is to blame Kristen Wiig. Who can forget the fervor that surrounded &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, and the countless think-pieces that heralded the coming of an exciting new world of female-driven comedies? The film’s wild crossover success (evidenced, for me, by the fact my 81-year-old grandma also loved the film) resulted in a critical and financial bonanza, including two Academy Award nominations (Best Original Screenplay for Wiig and Annie Mumolo, and a Supporting Actress nod for Melissa McCarthy). But Wiig seemingly took all that goodwill and burned it with a string of low-energy indie films (&lt;em&gt;Girl Most Likely&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hateship Loveship,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/3/30/friends-with-kids.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friends With Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, The Skeleton Twins&lt;/em&gt;). Maybe it was a conscious reaction to the pressure, but, so far, it certainly feels like a squandered opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the four years since &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, I don’t feel like we’re much further ahead. There are exceptions, of course. &lt;em&gt;The Heat&lt;/em&gt; made almost as much money as &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids,&lt;/em&gt; and co-starred McCarthy, who has made a valiant effort to be crowned the queen of comedy. Her crude clowning can kick ass, but her big test at solo stardom was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/7/24/tammy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tammy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which failed to generate significant business (or laughs). Her co-star, Sandra Bullock, also bucked the one-off comedy curse (&lt;em&gt;Miss Congeniality&lt;/em&gt;’s lackluster sequel, notwithstanding), but no one will ever consider the Academy Award-winner a comedy-first movie star. Same goes for Reese Witherspoon, Barbara Streisand, and Diane Keaton.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiig still seems to be the Great White Hope for female comedy superstardom. Her campaign got a serious boost this January when she was announced as one of the leads in the upcoming, all-female &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/22/ghosts-of-ghostbusters.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reboot (along with McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones). But any excitement generated by that bold decision was quickly deflated by the seemingly knee-jerk follow-up announcement telling us not to worry because, of course, there will  be an all-male &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; remake as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I’m so relieved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who’s to blame here? Is it the writers who can’t generate funny female-driven scripts? Is it the studios? Can they really be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; entrenched in sexism when audience demand is so obvious? From &lt;em&gt;Clueless&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/10/3/pitch-perfect.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pitch Perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, people buy tickets when something good is in theaters. And the talent pool for funny female performers has never been deeper: Emma Stone, Aubrey Plaza, Zooey Deschanel, Amy Schumer, Rose Byrne, Kat Dennings—all of them are talented enough toone day wear the crown. Even Rebel Wilson has a shot (even if she&amp;#39;s destined to always be the Josh Gad to McCarthy’s Jonah Hill). Then there’s Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Queen Latifa, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks, and Jennifer Aniston, all of whom are proven comedic talents, but seem to have only a fleeting interest at headlining rom-less coms. Or maybe they’ve just never had the right chance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I know is that we need more of what we’re seeing on TV every single week. It’s not hard for women to be funny. Or for them to be movie stars. So why can’t they be both?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Run All Night</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Genre films always walk a slippery slope. On the one hand, they offer the comfort of the familiar: the audience and filmmakers enter into an unspoken contract that dictates certain simple expectations will be met. On the other, simply meeting expectations isn’t enough; that familiar stuff must be expertly executed, and, in the very best cases, shown to us in a unique light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why I’ve opened my letter to you with this Genre 101 lesson. It’s pretty simple, really: your new movie, &lt;em&gt;Run All Night&lt;/em&gt;, is very much a film ruled by genre conventions. Yet I get the feeling that director Jaume Collet-Sera and writer Brad Ingelsby might have seen your character as the convention-breaker. Because every time you show up, &lt;em&gt;Run All Night&lt;/em&gt; suddenly goes from being predictable and uninspired to flat out ridiculous. And, well, pretty stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everything about &lt;em&gt;Run All Night&lt;/em&gt; is cookie-cutter. Stop me if you’ve heard any of this before: an aging mob boss who has gone (mostly) straight has a hot-headed son who may undo what he’s tried to achieve; another aging ex-enforcer (the boss’s longtime friend, natch) has become a drunk, and has become estranged from his own straight-arrow son; through a series of plot contrivances, the two sons have a run-in that eventually leaves the old-timers gunning for each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may come as a shock, but regret, revenge, and betrayal are not the most unique themes to bring to the mob genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this all sounds facetious, but I’m being a little bit sincere. The way it plays out, Collet-Sera and Ingelsby seem to think they’ve invented these tragic mob archetypes from whole cloth. They want to play at the level of tragic opera. Structuring the film as a flashback from what appears to be our hero’s final minutes tips their hand: they want events to feel predetermined. But instead they’re merely predictable (see above re: the knife’s edge of genre picture). Their true intentions are revealed in the casting. When you cast Liam Neeson as the rundown killer forced back into action to protect his son, we all know the movie they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to make: the Liam-Neeson-disposes-of-bad-men-with-ruthless-efficiency movie. The new twist here is that he feels, I don’t know, a little sadder about being such an efficient killer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it was your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filmmakers play it mostly straight, trying heir damnedest to convince us that everything is &lt;em&gt;really heavy.&lt;/em&gt; Lord knows Harry Gregson-Williams’s score attempts to portray the crushing moral weight behind every plot point. Sure there’s a lot actions scenes that use a shaky camera in place of actual choreography, but it’s a very sad shaky cam. The less said about the silly 3D computer effects that move us from one location to another, the better (okay, I’ll say this much: at least it’s abandoned early.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then you show up as the highly-skilled contract killer, Price. And you look – and act – like a cross between The Terminator and Brother Mouzone form &lt;em&gt;The Wire.&lt;/em&gt; Seriously, you’re just as ruthless, unstoppable, and even more impervious to pain. You’re even given a laser-sight pistol that shines through smoke, finding targets before they know you’re there (though no one specifies if it‘s actually a “phased plasma rifle with a 20 watt range”). Your character is imagined only in references to other, better characters. The most incongruous of these is your &lt;em&gt;Bullit&lt;/em&gt;-inspired trench coat—a better reference to that movie could have been made by filming coherent car chases. As you walked though corridors, killing policemen and mobsters with robot-like determination, the hollowness of &lt;em&gt;Run All Night&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s pretensions are given harsh relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you disappeared for a while, and the movie continued on as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably sounds like the ridiculous over-the-top-ness of your character was a welcome relief from the mediocrity of the rest of the movie – even rereading my own description of it strikes me that way – but it merely annoyed me. It was like eating at a restaurant that has reached beyond its abilities, then fed candy corn between courses: a bland meal made unpalatable by the addition of something that’s terrible even on its own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong—I don’t blame &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; for this. The conception and execution of your character speaks to the video game aesthetic Collet-Sera can’t quite escape. Like the movie itself, your character is a bunch of influences from better movies sloppily thrown together in the hope that their sum will some how create a better whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cinderella</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your track record is pretty impressive. &lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Other Boleyn Girl&lt;/em&gt;—not only are you a master of period films, you’ve also had the pleasure of measuring Leonardo DiCaprio’s inseam more than a few times (yeah, I’m jealous—who wouldn’t be?). But even with all of those films on your resume, bringing a fairy tale like Cinderella to life must feel like one of the biggest feats of your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might think that adapting a classic like this would make your job easier. But, boy, would they be wrong. Crafting a revival like this is hard work. You have to get it exactly right. Especially with a story as familiar as Cinderella: she’s the innocent girl with a pure heart forced to serve her stepmom and stepsisters, only to be transformed into a princess by her fairy godmother so she can meet her prince. Stroke of midnight, glass slippers—you know, Disney 101.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you didn’t let the expectations stifle you. You met the challenge and managed to perfectly capture the magic and flamboyance of the story through the wardrobe you created, from duotone slim-cut jackets that make princes charming to the the fluid movement of Victorian-era gowns that turn lonely country girls into the belle of the ball. Later, when the wicked stepsisters showed up, they didn’t need to say a word to reveal their idiocy—the loud, jewel-encrusted clothing they wore told me everything I needed to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s during ballroom scene, when the men and maidens hit the dance floor, that your strategic use of colour is most striking. Draping all the other guests in warm tones while Cinderella is wrapped in striking light blue fabric kept my eyes locked on her as she drifted through the sea of revellers was brilliant. No spotlight needed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and director Kenneth Branagh clearly used the 1950 version as a template for this live-action adaptation, but you managed to avoid turning it into yet another reimagining basted in unnecessary grittiness. I’ll admit, after &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Oz: The Great and Powerful&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Maleficent&lt;/em&gt;, it was refreshing to see a retelling that relied on the storybook enchantment that made the story popular in the first place. I don’t need to see Prince Charming riding a Harley and blasting fools with a sawed-off (or do I?). With live-action versions of &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dumbo&lt;/em&gt; recently announced, I suspect there will be a creative tug-o’-war about which approach to take. If you happen to be involved in any of these upcoming movies, please do your best to steer them down the lighter path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, this film is good. Not great, but good. Hell, all I know is that it’s been years since I’ve seen the old animated version, and you made me remember what it was like to feel the bippity, the boppity, and most definitely the boo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have Courage and Be Kind,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

				<title>&#39;71</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It is films like &lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt; that remind all of us why cinema can be called an art form. There is no commercial rationale for this film, no real clamor for an intimate picture about one English soldier and his harrowing experiences in Northern Ireland during the height of the unrest in 1971. In fact, without you and your support it is unlikely &lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt; would have seen the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extraordinary film. Affecting and subtly peppered with the kind of bucolic tragedy that occupies sectarian conflicts across the world, &lt;em&gt;‘71&lt;/em&gt; honors the ideals you champion: developing young talent and helping to tell stories that are aesthetically rigorous while still remaining approachable to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt; is a straightforward thriller. A young British soldier gets separated from his unit during a daytime raid on a Catholic block in Belfast, and then the rest of the film is occupied with his struggle to find his way back to his barracks. The depth of the work comes from the young soldier’s interactions with the various factions (and the individuals that comprise them) as he makes his fraught journey back to what he believes is safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filmmaking is remarkably assured for any director but especially for someone making their feature film debut. Yann Demange is, not incidentally, someone you (and other privately and publicly funded institutions) have helped nurture throughout his career. This is a fine example of how properly funded and supported infrastructure can lead to some extraordinary work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cinematography is top notch, the editing is fluid and clear, and the story bangs along at a pitch perfect clip. The performances are uniformly solid. The only real standout—aside from the lead performance by Jack O’Connell—is Corey McKinley, a young actor playing an unnamed Loyalist youth. He owns the screen for a seven-minute stretch that pivots the whole film. McKinley manages to be both precociously assertive and somehow tragic as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a visual artistry to the film that comes close to overshadowing the narrative but Demange ultimately exercises shrewd judgment in where he puts his camera. Thrillers seem to work best, for me at least, when they remain restrained and understated. This film never forgets that dramatic tension derives from humans having to make decisions in a fundamentally clouded moral universe. For each character there are no good options, just ones that are more, or less, evil and self-serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘71&lt;/em&gt; contains useful echoes of Sydney Pollack’s &lt;em&gt;Three Days of The Condor&lt;/em&gt;. It features a protagonist who is resourceful and capable trying to work through a byzantine and largely inscrutable political maze. Ultimately though, he is at the mercy of the people he encounters along the way, and it is how those interactions play out that determine his fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘71&lt;/em&gt; also has echoes of some of the best of the American films made in the late sixties and early seventies. It seems that a lot of modern filmmakers (JC Chandor and now Demange, just to name two) are taking their cues from people like Lumet, Scorsese and even Friedkin–producing muscular, spare dramas with a strong emphasis on good scripts and interesting characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for whatever part you have in encouraging this kind of good work I cannot thank you enough, BFI. This was an unlooked for gem in what seems to be a bit of a renaissance for films made for adults.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Housebound</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s astonishing how easy you make it look, man. Blending horror and comedy in a manner that keeps one from overpowering the other is always a tricky feat. Frankly, it&amp;#39;s difficult to think of any recent films that have successfully managed it. That’s why your whip-smart script for &lt;em&gt;Housebound&lt;/em&gt; is so special—it brings the funny and the scary together beautifully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all starts with your strong handling of the characters. A question that inevitably comes up during the course of a haunted house flick is: &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t they just leave?&amp;quot; Sure, you have your &lt;em&gt;Insidious&lt;/em&gt;es and your &lt;em&gt;Paranormal Activitie&lt;/em&gt;s which explain it away by revealing that the supernatural activity is bound to a person instead of a location. But I quite dig your practical solution: because of the electronic monitoring device around her ankle, petty criminal Kylie is forced to deal with sinister goings-on, lest she violate the terms of her house arrest.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat and simple. Yet you provide us with a nice about-face later on when Kylie is given an opportunity to escape, only to stay for purely altruistic reasons. The more she learns about the house&amp;#39;s bloody past, as well as a killer who has escaped justice, the more her motivations evolve. She undergoes genuine moments of growth, and doesn’t just make decisions solely to benefit the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to share a brief thought or two about Amos, the security guard tasked with monitoring our protagonist: you so easily could have made him the stock asshole who scoffs when evidence of the supernatural first rears its head, but his boyish enthusiasm and immediate willingness to help is incredibly charming. He’s yet another great character that elevates this already great movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit back to what I was saying before: it&amp;#39;s impressive how carefully you tread the line between comedic and full-on horror elements. There&amp;#39;s a great bit with dial-up internet, terrific banter between Kylie and Amos, and some outrageously zany gore gags that bring to mind the early work of Peter Jackson. But there is also genuine tension when there needs to be, and we never lose sight of just how high the stakes are for our protagonists. What best exemplifies this balancing of contrasting tones is the climax. It features one of the best extended showdown-with-a-killer sequences I&amp;#39;ve seen in recent memory, it manages to be gut-bustingly funny one second and hand-wringingly intense the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I felt a slight twinge of disappointment when the movie shifted gears and the nature of what&amp;#39;s was truly on at the house was cast in a different light. But that speaks more to my personal expectations, and it was certainly a clever and unexpected direction to take the story. It hit some unexpectedly emotional beats as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing you&amp;#39;ve heard the news that &lt;em&gt;Housebound&lt;/em&gt; is already being optioned for an American remake. It’s so bafflingly unnecessary that I can&amp;#39;t even put it in words (maybe just a series of inarticulate noises). It seems a safe bet that we can save ourselves a little time and write it off as being inferior.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years from now, if &lt;em&gt;Housebound&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t mentioned in the same breath as other horror-comedy classics like &lt;em&gt;Dead Alive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Evil Dead II&lt;/em&gt;, than I&amp;#39;ll be sure to eat my hat.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Chappie</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When making a big budget, dystopian flick like Neill Blomkamp’s &lt;em&gt;Chappie,&lt;/em&gt; your robots truly matter. How they look and whether or not their appearance reflects the mood you are trying to convey is essential to the film’s success or failure. This is especially true if one of the robots is the title character of the aforementioned multi-million dollar extravaganza. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; (once it shed it’s Schwarzenegger) looked liked the robot in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. James Cameron would now be directing the line at McDonalds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did a man’s work in helping to develop the visual aesthetic of this particular robot. Chappie is perfectly modulated to allow Sharlto Copley’s motion capture performance to shine through. However, it is a significant problem when a motion capture performance is by far the best part of a film that has a number of actual humans as featured players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chappie—&lt;/em&gt;the film as opposed to the robot—is a godawful mess, narratively as well as conceptually. The casting ranges from poor (Hugh Jackman, paradoxically both wasted and ill-chosen) to ballsy (Die Antwoord’s Ninja and Yolandi Visser) to curiously misused (Sigourney Weaver and Dev Patel).  But they all recede into the background whenever the titular character is on the screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chappie&lt;/em&gt; is both derivative and an homage to several films including &lt;em&gt;Short Circuit,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Robocop&lt;/em&gt; and even makes a more than a cursory nod to Blomkamp’s own &lt;em&gt;District 9&lt;/em&gt;. What it doesn’t do, however, is find its own voice. It lurches wildly in tone from gritty to comic to maudlin to occasionally effective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of that is the script. Too often it relies on what seem to be improvisational moments between Chappie and his adoptive parents—Ninja and Visser—as they try to gangsta Chappie up in order to aid them with their comically ineffective schemes. There is a throwaway plot involving Jackman and his rivalry with Patel. Sigourney Weaver, again wasted in a largely throwaway role, plays a weak echo of her Queen Bitch from &lt;em&gt;Working Girl.&lt;/em&gt; At no point in the film do any of these disparate threads cohere in a way that is at all convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single compelling moment comes early on in the film when Chappie is abandoned to the streets of Johannesburg; it is in this sequence that you see most clearly where Blomkamp can create moments of real human pathos. It is a stark, unrelenting five minutes that stayed with me long after the film ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason why this sequence succeeds—where most of the film fails—is because it focuses on Chappie’s awakening to the harsh realities of the world he has been born into. It also works because it is uncluttered by any of the cardboard characters that usually fill Blomkamp’s South African landscape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copley’s MoCap performance is effective because the robot design evokes a human in form but is still non-specific enough for anyone to identify with—it is the perfect blank slate for the audience to project themselves upon. Chappie also has rudimentary facial expressions that work in ways that are a little surprising, given such a limited palette. He is a creation that deserves, as do you, a far better film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Blomkamp might be better served by adapting other people’s work. Maybe then he could find a way to incorporate the magic you helped him create into a film that compliments that magic—instead of muting it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Unfinished Business</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the crew members listed in Ken Scott’s &lt;em&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/em&gt;, you have the coolest credit. I have no idea what exactly it means, but it has earned you this letter because...well, why the hell not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the film, Dan, Timothy, and Mike have one last chance to save their fledgling mineral sales company. They chase a big client all the way to Berlin for a seal-the-deal handshake, and they need to deliver a presentation that blows away their competition (and former boss). If they don’t, Timothy can’t divorce his wife and Dan can’t send his angsty kids to private school. So there’s a quest. And a ticking clock. But unfortunately there’s no real sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I forgot to mention: Dan’s company sells swarf, which is basically manufacturing waste. This film is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarf&quot;&gt;swarf&lt;/a&gt;: probably important to those who need to sell it, but I can’t be arsed to get too enthused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I usually find the American-in-Europe culture clash set-up very funny. Language barriers, weird food, European permissiveness versus American prudishness—the ingredients are all there. The film sets itself up as a road trip/caper/fish out of water comedy, but doesn’t embrace any of the tropes or conventions that make those subgenres funny. It holds the promise of some potentially hilarious running gags, but none of them pay off. The German GPS bit should have been milked for all it was worth, and, as always, there’s a giant pile of kinky German sex jokes that could have been plundered. But these opportunities are brushed aside in favour of a family/bullying subplot that feels shoehorned in, and endless scenes of the guys “going over the presentation just &lt;em&gt;one more time&lt;/em&gt;.” Their arrival in Berlin coincides with the Folsom Europe festival, a huge marathon, and a G8 summit, but instead we get to watch Dan pore over his slides for the umpteenth time. Which brings me to my next gripe: none of the film’s obstacles are very obstacle-y. I feel like it should take more than a few paint pellets to the torso to sneak into a G8 summit. None of the calamities that befall the protagonists seem to last more than a couple of scenes before being neatly resolved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it feels way too phoned-in. The filmmakers seemed too indifferent for me to care about the exploits (such as they are) of Dan, Timothy, and Mike, or for me to want them to succeed. Maybe if I knew how ‘Master of the Sword’ fit into the endeavour, I might have been more impressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, it had something to do with the scene in the bathroom of the leather club, didn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When you’ve watched films for close to fifty years, you occasionally get to see a performer’s entire career play out in front of you. Sometimes it’s painful (Jon Voight), sometimes it’s funny (Jack Nicholson), and every once in a while it’s a privilege (you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear &lt;em&gt;The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&lt;/em&gt; is hardly the best showcase for your work. A meandering, often incoherent mess, it is a film that lurches from moment to moment without a whole lot of intention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a trifling contrivance about the necessity of obtaining a second hotel (ostensibly to house the incipient hordes of adventurous, elderly British ex-pats of reduced circumstance) to compliment the first hotel, but the title kind of says it all. This is definitely the second best Exotic Marigold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first film—simply titled &lt;em&gt;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&lt;/em&gt;—was a clever, engaging piece of entertainment. But in this iteration Dev Patel is carrying far too much narrative weight and screen time for a character that is so thinly drawn. Nor is Patel is good enough to transcend the material. As for most of the rest of the cast—which includes Richard Gere and David Strathairn—they seem happy just to collect their paychecks and wander around Jaipur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when either you, Maggie Smith or Bill Nighy are on screen something truly alchemical happens; lead is in fact turned to gold. It really is magical to see. I think it has something to do with simple professionalism as well as talent. There is never a moment of sloppiness or mugging for the camera. I believe absolutely everything you and you fellow Brits say. And given the thinness of this script, that is high praise indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a glance at your resume is enough to see how varied and challenging your career has been. Those choices also speak to a fundamental strength that many UK actors possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theatre actors, especially Shakespearean theatre actors, cannot take a moment off. That continual awareness is often painfully apparent, especially in contrast with people who turn off the moment the camera pivots away from them. There are several moments throughout &lt;em&gt;The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&lt;/em&gt; when you seem to be acting in an entirely different film than most of the rest of the cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few scenes where you and Maggie Smith get to share the screen together are particularly worthwhile. Not for any De Niro-Pacino type pyrotechnics but simply for the joy of watching two absolute masters make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. Perhaps this is one of the reasons the film is so uneven and directionless. It is as if the Director John Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker figured: we’ve got all of these great people together again—what can go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, quite a bit. Since your long-budding romance with Nighy is reduced to an awkward sub-plot and the rest of the film is filled with far lesser lights, I kept bouncing back and forth between being engaged and then utterly disinterested. Not exactly a great rhythm. This is a film you watch on a lazy Sunday, not something you spend money and time going to a theatre to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perverse way you, Maggie Smith and Nighy made this film worse, simply by showing how much better it may have been had you all featured more prominently. In particular your performance was a pointed reminder of why you have endured and flourished—while lesser lights have long since faded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for a lifetime of beautiful poetry, Dame Judi. &lt;/p&gt;
