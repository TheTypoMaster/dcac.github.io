				<title>Review: Ted 2</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/ted-2.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Hasbro, Villain, <br />
  				<p>When kids play with one of your Nerf toys, or adults sit down with your classic board game Clue, their goal is to turn off part of their brains and just enjoy themselves for an hour or two. The same is true of stupid comedies. Maybe this is why it makes sense that you’re a part of the stoner buddy-movie sequel <em>Ted 2</em>. Who would know better than you that sometimes people just want to have fun without searching for some deeper purpose? And yet, surprisingly, there are moments when <em>Ted 2</em> manages to do both.</p>

  				<p>Dear Steve Coogan, Actor, <br />
  				<p>This will come as no surprise to you, but you don’t actually appear in this movie. I’m not going to let that stop me from wishing you did.</p>

				<title>Review: Inside Out</title>

  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/inside-out.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Pete Docter, Co-Screenwriter, <br />
  				<p>You did a lot more than write the screenplay for <em>Inside Out</em>. Along with Ronaldo Del Carmen you also developed the original story and co-directed it. But I want to talk about how <em>Inside Out</em> is structured as a story, so “Co-screenwriter” is going to have to do for now.</p>

				<title>Review: Dope</title>

  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/dope.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear McGuffin, Plot Mechanism, <br />
  				<p><em>Dope</em> is as much a cultural artifact as it is a story. An artifact because it often only makes sense in relationship to the films that it depends on to first inform, and prop up, its central premise—movies like <em>Juice</em>, <em>Boys N’ The Hood</em> and especially <em>Menace II Society.</em></p>

				<title>Review: Jurassic World</title>

  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/jurassic-world.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Jack Horner, Palaeontology Consultant, <br />
  				<p>You’re the most famous palaeontologist since Ross from <em>Friends</em>. Which is kind of sad because you’re <em>actually</em> a palaeontologist with years of study under your belt. Your behind-the-scenes presence in all the <em>Jurassic Park</em> releases has helped provide a realistic-ish portrayal of what would happen if humans faced off against dinosaurs. </p>

				<title>Review: Entourage</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/entourage.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Doug Ellin, Writer/Creator/Director, <br />
  				<p>Eight seasons and a movie. That’s a long run for any creative endeavour. Just keeping up the energy is a feat in and of itself—especially for something as fundamentally empty as <em>Entourage</em>. The Hollywood adventures of Vinnie Chase and his gang of charisma-free bros—brother and fellow actor Johnny Drama, his manager E, and driver Turtle (I’d name the actors, but let’s not pretend they’ll have any kind of career outside this)—felt like something that warranted three, maybe four seasons. It was always a trifle of a show, and the longer it went on it was obvious that there never was any <em>there</em> there. Nothing. At all. How could you keep returning to mine something that emptied its reserves so long ago?</p>

				<title> Feature: Requiem for an Underdog</title>

  				<![CDATA[

  				<p>Dear 1985, <br />
  				1985 was the hardest year of my life, and one movie helped me get through it. One gloriously bad movie that celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. That movie is <em>Rocky IV</em>.p>

				<title>Review: Spy</title>

  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/spy.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear ‘Homophobic Aunt’ Wig, Costume, <br />
  				<p>The ‘Melissa McCarthy movie’ has almost become a sub-sub-genre in itself; Packaged as comedy but somehow more horrifying than funny. The premise of any Melissa McCarthy movie seems to be ‘How obnoxious, dirty, and pathetic can we make her look? How deeply can we degrade and humiliate her character before people stop laughing?” It has often bugged me that all we seem to get is more <em>Tammy</em>, when all I want is to see her play the President in a remake of <em>Air Force One</em> (come on, you <em>know</em> how hard that movie would bring it).</p>

				<title>Review: San Andreas</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/san-andreas.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Jeanne Bautista, Disaster Victim, <br />
  				<p>The term “blockbuster” has always been rooted in violence. Originating from aerial bombs dropped during World War II, the word was officially adopted by the media in the 70s (after <em>Jaws</em>) to describe a massive “hit” at the box-office. But the “blockbuster” has now become quite literal. Studios decided at some point in the past few years that the secret formula for what sells has been hiding in plain sight all along: bust the block.</p>
