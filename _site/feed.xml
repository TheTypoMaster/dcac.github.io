				<title>&#39;71</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It is films like &lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt; that remind all of us why cinema can be called an art form. There is no commercial rationale for this film, no real clamor for an intimate picture about one English soldier and his harrowing experiences in Northern Ireland during the height of the unrest in 1971. In fact, without you and your support it is unlikely &lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt; would have seen the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extraordinary film. Affecting and subtly peppered with the kind of bucolic tragedy that occupies sectarian conflicts across the world, &lt;em&gt;‘71&lt;/em&gt; honors the ideals you champion: developing young talent and helping to tell stories that are aesthetically rigorous while still remaining approachable to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt; is a straightforward thriller. A young British soldier gets separated from his unit during a daytime raid on a Catholic block in Belfast, and then the rest of the film is occupied with his struggle to find his way back to his barracks. The depth of the work comes from the young soldier’s interactions with the various factions (and the individuals that comprise them) as he makes his fraught journey back to what he believes is safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filmmaking is remarkably assured for any director but especially for someone making their feature film debut. Yann Demange is, not incidentally, someone you (and other privately and publicly funded institutions) have helped nurture throughout his career. This is a fine example of how properly funded and supported infrastructure can lead to some extraordinary work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cinematography is top notch, the editing is fluid and clear, and the story bangs along at a pitch perfect clip. The performances are uniformly solid. The only real standout—aside from the lead performance by Jack O’Connell—is Corey McKinley, a young actor playing an unnamed Loyalist youth. He owns the screen for a seven-minute stretch that pivots the whole film. McKinley manages to be both precociously assertive and somehow tragic as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a visual artistry to the film that comes close to overshadowing the narrative but Demange ultimately exercises shrewd judgment in where he puts his camera. Thrillers seem to work best, for me at least, when they remain restrained and understated. This film never forgets that dramatic tension derives from humans having to make decisions in a fundamentally clouded moral universe. For each character there are no good options, just ones that are more, or less, evil and self-serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘71&lt;/em&gt; contains useful echoes of Sydney Pollack’s &lt;em&gt;Three Days of The Condor&lt;/em&gt;. It features a protagonist who is resourceful and capable trying to work through a byzantine and largely inscrutable political maze. Ultimately though, he is at the mercy of the people he encounters along the way, and it is how those interactions play out that determine his fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘71&lt;/em&gt; also has echoes of some of the best of the American films made in the late sixties and early seventies. It seems that a lot of modern filmmakers (JC Chandor and now Demange, just to name two) are taking their cues from people like Lumet, Scorsese and even Friedkin–producing muscular, spare dramas with a strong emphasis on good scripts and interesting characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for whatever part you have in encouraging this kind of good work I cannot thank you enough, BFI. This was an unlooked for gem in what seems to be a bit of a renaissance for films made for adults.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Revolution is Upon Us</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago you could always tell the difference between a movie made in Hollywood and just about anywhere else. It was like they carried a watermark. No matter how banal the content, how utterly derivative the plot, how wooden the acting, the one thing you could pretty much say about any studio film made in Hollywood was that they looked really good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was because Hollywood had accumulated, over the course of several decades, an almost complete monopoly on the mechanics of film production. It wasn’t just about huge budgets, it was about support infrastructure, technical know how and the means of production: cinematography, editing, sound production and even sound stages, color separation, film processing and finally distribution networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To match that kind of out of the gate firepower would require the resources of a national government. So, with a few exceptions, most films that were produced outside of Hollywood were, whatever their latent artistic qualities, working at a huge disadvantage. They just weren’t as shiny as what Hollywood was pounding out year after year. To compete on the world stage required both money and technical resources that were inordinately concentrated in the southern end of the State of California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And listening to the some of the doomsayers from the last awards season you would think almost nothing has changed over the last twenty years. Just lately there has been a constant lament amongst many in the industry about how the death of small and medium budget films made for people over twenty-five is upon us. That we were doomed to two binary choices—artistically ambitious but technically constrained micro-budget films (a kind of perpetual dogme 95, not by choice but by necessity) and a never-ending barrage of Hollywood summer bombast, beginning in March and ending sometime in late October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t seem to be the case at all, as it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filmmaking has quietly entered a renaissance of unequalled quality and diversity. Independently produced movies have never been more interesting, beautiful, varied, and accessible. The voices that are being heard are more distinct in ethnicity, as well as class and geography, even gender, than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a partial list of non-Hollywood films from just the last year: &lt;em&gt;’71&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/2/4/leviathan.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leviathan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/2/20/timbuktu.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/2/9/ida.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/6/11/under-the-skin.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under The Skin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Girlhood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/3/2/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as independently produced North American films like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/29/nightcrawler.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NightCrawler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/20/a-most-violent-year.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Most Violent Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; or straight up entertainments like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/7/3/snowpiercer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snowpiercer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/30/john-wick.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put lie to the idea that small to medium budget films of exceptional quality are somehow disappearing from the landscape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filmmakers themselves are Korean, Mauritanian, Russian, Iranian, British, French, men, women, and transgendered, outsiders, neophytes, mavericks, political radicals and absolutely beholden to no one. And you know what the best part is? We all can see these films pretty much at the click of a mouse and for a couple of bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is often lost in the mountains of snark generated by people who often have, at most, a passing familiarity with any film that isn’t on a constant loop in their feeds. And the declinists in the room—with their moaning about how films for adults are so vanishingly rare—expose themselves for the culturally myopic whiners and curmudgeons that they are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for them seems to be that the center of gravity for this renaissance isn’t located in Southern California. It isn’t even on the North American continent. If you had to assign a geographic ground zero it would probably be somewhere in North Africa, or perhaps Eastern Europe, depending on the particular year. And from people who often mouth platitudes about diversity and the Hollywood monoculture I too often hear the words: ‘I haven’t seen that yet’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be that a lack of access was a pretty valid defense. If Hollywood didn’t pay it didn’t play but that is a red herring at this point in the game. If you’re not seeing the diversity in film that you would like to, you probably aren’t looking very hard. Just off of the top of my head, some of the most interesting films from last year were from women directors: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/8/the-babadook.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babadook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Girlhood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Lights&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/21/selma.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And finding these films usually requires less work than making a sandwich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single greatest thing about the technological change that has occurred around filmmaking in the last twenty-five years is simply this: the means of production are now firmly in the hands of the content creators. Hollywood’s monopoly on production is broken and the grip it currently still enjoys on distribution is soon to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it isn’t much of a stretch these days to find all kinds of films for all sorts of tastes. More to the point, most of the cinema being produced outside of Hollywood isn’t what used to be considered art house fare: with their low budget productions and often impenetrable and esoteric narratives. And if you were lucky you might find these rare gems playing on one screen in NYC at 12:00 AM on a Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, for me to see &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt;—the Academy Award winner for best foreign language film—I had to open up iTunes on my computer and pay $5.99.  To see &lt;em&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/em&gt; I had to walk a few blocks to TIFF and see one of the most beautiful and unsettling films I have ever experienced up on a big screen—but I have no doubt that it will be available on any number of legitimate venues in the near future, as well as old school DVD and Blu-Ray. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days the strength of much of non-Hollywood film is in its middlebrow aesthetic and its capacity to speak coherently to mass audiences while managing to avoid simply existing as product. Timbuktu is set in a foreign land that few North Americans would recognize yet it is perfectly comprehensible to even my wretchedly tarnished sensibilities—as well as beautifully shot and conventional in its narrative arcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, I tend to think this can be nothing but good for Hollywood itself. Challenged and often aesthetically overtaken these days, it will be interesting to see how the Monolith responds. My money is on a resurgence of the kind of dynamic filmmaking the major studios haven’t had much to do with since the mid to late seventies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t always a curse, as it turns out, to live in interesting times.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;While on the surface &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night&lt;/em&gt; is a vampire story, it seems far more interested in conveying atmosphere and emotion than it does in giving us a traditional narrative experience, and you set up a wonderful shot near the halfway mark of the film that perfectly encapsulates this mission statement. In a completely dialogue free scene, the titular &lt;em&gt;Girl&lt;/em&gt; stands facing away from co-lead Arash as he approaches, then ever-so-slowly turns around and relaxes her head against his chest. It&amp;#39;s a lovely bit of visual storytelling, and says so much more about these characters and what they&amp;#39;re feeling than words could. This one shot makes it perfectly clear that this is a movie about two lonely people finding a connection, however improbable it may be.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have taken the easy route and lent this a film a drab visual style to mirror the despair of living in Bad City, a heavily industrialized wasteland whose residents enjoy varying states of isolation and suffering, choosing either to slip into drug abuse or seek companionship from the wrong sort of people. Though it must be said that the movie isn&amp;#39;t nearly as heavy as all that; it certainly never exploits its characters. Instead, your evocative black-and-white cinematography makes even the mundane and ugly appear beautiful. Which is quite an achievement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously absent are the visceral thrills typically associated with this type of genre picture; outside of dispatching one of Bad City&amp;#39;s more loathsome inhabitants, writer/director Ana-Lily Amirpour doesn’t rely on violence to give her story momentum, which, in an age when cinematic thrills come cheaper than ever, is a classy decision that reflects an intent to make &lt;em&gt;Girl&lt;/em&gt; more of a mood piece than a full on horror film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupled with ingenious costume design that has the Girl&amp;#39;s chador double as both traditional garb and billowing cloak, you work wonders when it comes to lending The Girl a screen presence that feels truly unique and iconic.  Whether it’s a hooded figure slipping in and out of the city&amp;#39;s all-encompassing shadows while stalking her prey, or, in what might be my favourite shot in the film, riding a skateboard down the street with the edges of her chador billowing around her like  a bat’s wings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;#39;d be remiss without mentioning how agreeable your camera finds lead actress Sheila Vand. Her remarkable performance runs the gambit from palpable vulnerability to great savagery. She promises to inflict grave harm upon a child if he were to ever stop being a &amp;quot;good little boy&amp;quot;—and we believe her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breathing a new life into a stale sub-genre, &lt;em&gt;A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night&lt;/em&gt; is being sold as &amp;quot;the first Iranian vampire-western.”  Here&amp;#39;s hoping it won&amp;#39;t be the last.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Focus</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you think the &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; production office sent out a secret call sheet on the day you arrived on set reminding the cast and crew to leave their valuables at home? You call yourself a “gentleman thief,” but one can never be too careful. A con artist must cultivate a certain kind of sociopathic charm in order to be successful; a talent for knowing what people secretly want and then giving it to them—or at least delivering the illusion. Pickpocketing, it seems, requires a different set of skills: the ability to blend in, to be simultaneously seen and not seen. You came to fame by pickpocketing President Jimmy Carter’s Secret Service agents, relieving them of the keys to his motorcade. You must have talked a pretty good game, because instead of ending up behind bars, you became a consultant for law enforcement and security agencies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that 
the Secret Service and the makers of &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; can agree on at least one thing; clever and charming criminals are a lot of fun to be around. At least for a while. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; is typically convoluted: veteran con-man Nicky takes neophyte pickpocket Jess under his wing for a multi-million dollar operation during the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Three years later, after hearts and trust have been broken, they meet again in Buenos Aires where Nicky is helping a billionaire Formula One race-car team owner (and Jess’ new boyfriend) cheat his way to a win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After meeting-cute in a failed “jealous husband” scam, Jess begs Nicky to show her some of his tricks (which are actually yours). As he casually chats with her about the art of pickpocketing, he relieves her of various belongings – a ring, a watch, a wallet – and returns them to her while she watches, dumbfounded. He tells her that the trick is in diverting a mark’s focus, making them see what they want to see. &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; takes this advice to heart. Con/Heist films are best when they (a) don’t take themselves too seriously, and (b) give the audience lots of beautiful things and people to pay attention to. Will Smith’s Nicky is all brooding suaveness in dark bespoke suits, and Margot Robbie’s Jess pops like bubblegum with bright pink dresses and wide-eyed enthusiasm. Their chemistry is palpable, their romance inevitable, but we’re always anticipating the bait and switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve given TED talks on the science behind awareness manipulation and why we’re psychologically wired to want to believe what we see. The pickpocket design you delivered for &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; – specifically the one protracted scene in New Orleans – is certainly exciting to watch. As Nicky’s team introduces Jess to their system, the camera follows a series of expertly executed lifts and boosts as it skims through a crowd of revelers gathered in the streets. Post-scam, the loot is displayed in a satisfying sequence reminiscent of that ode to excess, &lt;em&gt;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&lt;/em&gt;: hundreds of Piagets and Rolexes, jeweled rings and necklaces, and piles of money laid out in velvet lined cases. A high-stakes gambling scam during the Super Bowl involving the goofily creeptastic B.D. Wong is particularly nerve-wracking. This pace is exhilarating. But, unfortunately, isn’t sustained throughout this otherwise perfectly fun and funny con-man flick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the film changes locales to Buenos Aires, it loses some of its lustre, despite the dizzyingly sumptuous backdrop of brightly coloured cars, buildings, and women. It’s only a matter of time before alliances are broken and double-crosses are double-crossed. Up until now, the film could have lifted whatever it wanted from my purse, but, by the end, with only the obvious love story left to hold our attention, my focus was wandering. With some hilarious supporting performances by Gerald McRaney, Adrian Martinez, and the aforementioned Wong, &lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; does it’s best to divert our attention from its barely-better-than-average plot twists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left feeling like many of the audience members you’ve amused with your theatrical pickpocketing: it was a harmless good time, and I didn’t mind feeling a little bit cheated.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Tale Of Princess Kaguya</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It must be a thankless task to try and translate a work so thoroughly drenched in the folklore of a specific culture; because no matter how well you perform, something will be inevitably lost. There is no way to transmit the fundamental conceits that underpin the whole of the narrative. To do that would require a lifetime of work for both you and the audience. However, even if what you managed is a lesser work than the original, it still shines very brightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tale Of Princess Kaguya,&lt;/em&gt; an animated film from Studio Ghibli, is a beautiful, meandering film. Like much of traditional Japanese cinema, it is least troubled with pacing and plot. Tone and mood are the primary concerns here. The animation is loose and seemingly naturalistic, the score is haunting and subtle and the dialogue is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inherently pastoral film &lt;em&gt;The Tale of Princess Kaguya&lt;/em&gt; expresses a love of nature and a thoughtful examination of the cycles of birth and death. The sometimes misguided aspirations that parents force on their children is also one of the central themes, as well as a lot of gentle nudging about greed and social posturing and the often ridiculous pomp that props up rigidly defined class systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choices that director Isao Takahata makes (he also directed &lt;em&gt;Grave of the Fireflies&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most appallingly effective anti-war films I have ever seen) to tell a story so filled with myth and the supernatural are at the heart of its effectiveness. Compared to almost any animated film these days &lt;em&gt;The Tale Of Princess Kaguya&lt;/em&gt; is noteworthy for it’s complete lack of visual pyrotechnics. This is a simple story told simply. The magic is in how that becomes so affecting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole film is less a fable and more a series of metaphoric observations about some pretty universal concerns. What is truly valuable in life? Is it possible to be yourself as a young person and not disappoint your parents? Mostly though there is no lesson other than we are all variable creatures with many flaws and some strengths. Life is often filled with meaningless obligation and trivial strife so the moments of joy are inevitably tinged with melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that seems trite it is only because I am failing in the translation. How the film evokes these sweeping, universal themes is earthy and quiet and utterly lacking in pretension. There is both a quiet joy and a pervasive sadness that every frame of this film somehow transmits. Part of this comes from the animation. The figures are simple and expressive and move with grace and elegance (except when they shouldn’t). The background art is exquisite, seamlessly reinforcing or contrasting whatever is happening in the foreground without drawing attention to itself. That it seems hand drawn is not just a stubborn adherence to tradition but a calculated, aesthetic choice that underlines the rustic slant of the whole project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tale Of Princess Kaguya&lt;/em&gt; is an art house film in the best sense of the word. It requires engagement on the part of the audience and the capacity to let go of your preconceptions about what a story is and how it can be told, but it rewards those efforts with a film that was truly beautiful and moving. Long-winded and meandering in a very Japanese way, the payoff is nonetheless extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what must be countless moments that simply don’t line up with my Western sensibilities and background this film and your translation of it connected with something fundamental in me. Studio Ghibli is perhaps the single most able advocate of a kind of honest reverence for the natural world that I can think of, and you captured that reverence beautifully. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The DUFF</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since I was in high school. Back in 2000, my “unique” ability to use editing software packed a real punch to my student campaign videos. With the help of a few spinning graphics – KAPOW! I was Batman. I even had a Robin: that slightly awkward friend recruited to make me seem cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, a DUFF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term isn’t mainstream and probably never will be. As an acronym (Designated Ugly Fat Friend), it’s far too front-and-center in all the film’s marketing to ever gain true cultural traction (or a pornographic sub-genre) the way MILF did after &lt;em&gt;American Pie&lt;/em&gt;. But damn if you and the filmmakers don’t try. Through playful graphics, you literally spell out the word (and countless other things) for people throughout the film. Everything is given the early iMovie treatment, with tweets, texts, and imaginary fireworks splashed all over the screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder I dug it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mae Whitman also helps, completely owning her starring role as the sub-sexy, totally approachable, literal girl-next-door. Her chiseled neighbour, played by Robbie Amell, is a jackass jock and childhood friend who gets recruited to give her the &lt;em&gt;She’s All That&lt;/em&gt; hair-shake transformation. The story and stock characters continue to evoke every teen comedy ever made since the 80s, right up to the advertising that tells us &lt;em&gt;The DUFF&lt;/em&gt; is this generation’s &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; (as your graphics stress). And yeah, it might be. Not by redefining anything, but simply by being funny, confident, and accessible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the DUFF of teen movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a world where geeks and geek-culture &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;does rule the world, that’s not an insult. The more Whitman’s character gets humiliated throughout the film, the more we love her. The “attack ad” videos created by the resident school hottie are complete with auto-tuning and slow-motion – the special sauce of many embarrassment-enhancing viral videos. But it’s the moments when the film doesn’t try to be era-specific that really work. We know exactly where everything is going (the prom), what’s going to happen (a big kiss), and who’s going to end up with who (duh), but be damned if I wasn’t rooting for it all to happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flare you added was nice, but it’s not what makes the film shine.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Birdman&#39;s Win is Bad News for TIFF</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So you lost another potential feather in your cap. Big deal, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, yes, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several years now, the Toronto International Film Festival’s identity has been built around launching “important Oscar films” to the world. It started around 1999, when &lt;em&gt;American Beauty&lt;/em&gt; claimed top prize at both the Oscars and TIFF. The next year, &lt;em&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/em&gt; was the people’s choice winner and a Best Picture nominee. This hot streak went cool until 2008’s &lt;em&gt;Slumdog&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Millionaire&lt;/em&gt;. That’s when things got serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danny Boyle himself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontosun.com/2014/08/08/tiff-2014-a-look-back-at-the-festivals-biggest-champions&quot;&gt;credited the TIFF award&lt;/a&gt; with saving &lt;em&gt;Slumdog&lt;/em&gt; from a straight-to-DVD release, and unfortunately (if not understandably) the praise went straight to your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year you position yourself as the ideal launching pad for films that hit the sweet-spot between critical and popular appeal. And you aren’t wrong. Every TIFF People’s Choice award winner since &lt;em&gt;Slumdog&lt;/em&gt; has either been nominated or won the Best Picture Oscar (save 2011’s out-of-nowhere and never-heard-from-again &lt;em&gt;Where Do We Go Now?&lt;/em&gt;). But it’s getting harder and harder to claim any pride in those victories—especially when films like &lt;em&gt;The King’s Speech&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;12 Years a Slave&lt;/em&gt; played to most of America’s top critics in Telluride before you were able to debut them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year seems to be proving the point. Your 2014 winner, &lt;em&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;/em&gt;, lived up to the promise with a Best Picture nomination, but just couldn’t gather enough steam to be a break-out hit (with either critics or the public). Instead, &lt;em&gt;Birdman&lt;/em&gt; swooped in and took Oscar’s top prize. Or, as you probably remember it, the film that everyone at TIFF lamented they couldn’t see because it had opened the Venice Film Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the problem. Critics, studio reps, and sales agents can only earmark so many festivals each year. Without the prestige of Cannes, bustling market of Berlin, caché of Venice, or discovery-factor of Sundance, you have always struggled to find a true identity. So you’ve opted for size and spectacle, becoming “the people’s festival” where the city’s diverse population stands in for the tastes of the world. But in that big, generic label, you’re getting lost in the shuffle—especially when so many other festivals are doing a better job of launching big films into the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sundance has been the biggest success story of the past few years by developing both breakout directors and seasoned visionaries through films like &lt;em&gt;Beasts of the Southern Wild&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Whiplash,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Boyhood&lt;/em&gt;. The Sundance Labs are also proving to be breading ground of talent, where producers can get an early peek at rising stars. Venice and Telluride are also a more appealing film going experience for critics, curating manageable schedules which prominently feature each of the 20-odd titles (as opposed to the hundreds that play at TIFF).  And then Cannes. Well...it’s Cannes. Even after holding a whole months-long exhibit dedicated solely to the work of David Cronenberg, Toronto’s prodigal son took his latest film &lt;em&gt;Maps to the Stars&lt;/em&gt; to La Croisette for its premiere instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you blame him, though? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ever, festivals matter. This year, every film nominated for Best Picture premiered at a film festival (compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2015/film/news/2015-academy-awards-analysis-87th-oscars-who-won-1201440039/&quot;&gt;60-80% in the past five years&lt;/a&gt;). The battle lines are no longer just drawn between studios, but savvy programmers from Cannes, New York, Venice, Sundance, and Telluride. The days when a film could sneak overseas and surprise audiences in North America are over. Online reviews make a film’s reputation, and, for better or worse, it’s virtually set in stone after the first premiere (even if it’s hidden from the public in the high altitudes of Colorado or canals of Venice). You know this all too well, which is why your artistic director, Cameron Bailey, implemented the controversial first weekend rule of TIFF, creating a two-tier status between Toronto world premieres and first-time Toronto screenings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might have to take things even further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be hard to argue that playing hardball has paid off in the first year, but you’re going to need to do something more than just pack theatres to make a splash in the film world. With the New York Film Festival taking more and more titles every year, Tribeca finding a groove, SXSW becoming a hub of innovation, and a slew of other festivals carving out niches, the “people’s festival” needs to do more than play the imitation game with Oscar winners if it wants to remain important.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Still Alice</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was curious to see how they would do it. How would the filmmakers of &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; show the audience what it feels like to have early-onset Alzheimer’s? How would we understand Alice’s fear and confusion when she begins to lose her memories? How would they visualize the details of her life as they flicker in and out of focus? They did it simply, eloquently—and quite literally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty year-old Alice Howland is out for a run on the campus of Columbia University, where she works as a linguistics professor, when suddenly she realizes that she has no idea where she is. It comes as a frightening shock to her (but not to us, since we’re waiting for the tell-tale signs of her disease to appear). What was once familiar – buildings, the quad, a staircase – suddenly appear to her as fuzzy, abstract splotches. As the camera pans to face her, she is shown in sharp relief against her fading reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is an ugly disease. My grandmother, who lived with us for most of my life, suffered from it. And so did we. It’s a disease that significantly affects the family. I was particularly interested in how &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; would deal with the hopelessness of watching a once competent and highly respected woman regress to a helpless, child-like state. I was worried that using a beautiful, relatively young actress as our window into this world would diminish the disease, giving it it that Vaseline-lensed sheen that makes these types of unpleasant stories palatable to the masses. And it would have been a complete wash, if you – and we – had anyone less skilled than Julianne Moore to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your relationship with actors is surprisingly intimate. In many ways, they are acting just for you. With every take you have to execute your duties flawlessly by keeping the actor perfectly in focus. The audience’s attention is automatically drawn to a sharper image, but as Alice’s focus is diminished, it’s the soft, faded edges of her world that draw us in. Julianne Moore appears in nearly every scene, and often the camera focuses on her face as she struggles to remember words or people or places. It’s a performance that works hard to defy the stereotype of the “beautiful lead with a terminal illness” trope; after all, this is an illness that we rarely see onscreen, and never before portrayed so fearlessly and without self-pity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many things the film teaches us is that Alzheimer’s is impervious to time. So we’re not sure how long it takes for Alice to slip away from herself. But you give us some clues. Before she is diagnosed, the camera is almost always fixed on her face. As the disease takes hold and Alice must let go of the life she once had, the camera follows her – through the Columbia library, or when she goes out for a run – like a proxy for her memories, trying desperately to catch up to her, but always falling short. Seasons pass; leaves change colours and fall, leaving branches bare; Alice and her husband John embrace on a rock by the ocean, the bokeh effect around them evoking a tender melancholy; flares bounce off the snowbanks that butt up against their brownstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all very pretty. &lt;em&gt;Too&lt;/em&gt; pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; blurs the line between wanting to authentically portray the effects Alzheimer’s has on the patient and the family, and trying to soften the truth for those unable to handle the grim reality a disease like this presents. When it gets it right, it feels like a sharp punch to the gut. But when it errs on the side of restraint it edges dangerously into Movie of the Week territory. Thankfully, Julianne Moore’s powerful performance rescues these latter moments from their maudlin potential. Having been a renowned professor, she is invited to give a speech to an audience of Alzheimer’s patients and doctors. When the camera pans to the faces of people in the audience slow clapping with tears in their eyes, I nearly laughed at such a tired cliché. But earlier, when Alice laments that she wishes she had cancer because at least she wouldn’t feel so ashamed, I cried, because, having dealt with both diseases, I know how painfully true that statement is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice’s situation – surrounded by a loving family, in a gorgeous New York brownstone and ocean-side summer home, nary a medical bill in sight – is not representative of the reality for most Alzheimer’s patients. But the conflict between Alice and her youngest daughter Lydia is familiar to anyone who has struggled with parental disapproval, and is refreshingly sugar-free. Kristen Stewart’s trademark mumbling is welcome here as Lydia and Alice are faced with an abrupt reversal of roles. This is when the film shifts from being a story about Alice to one about the people she is leaving behind. The difficult choices and daily frustrations an Alzheimer’s family faces is worthy of its own film, and though it takes up minimal space here, it is handled deftly and with dignity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt;, takes an uncomfortable topic and wraps it in an easy-to-swallow format; a beautiful woman, pretty surroundings, and a happy-ish ending. Unlike the far superior 2012 Cannes Palme D’or Winner &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt;, which tackles similar subject matter but without the soft-focus pretense, &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; aims for mass appeal. As a family member of an Alzheimer’s patient, I realize the importance of awareness, so I don’t necessarily think mass appeal is such a bad thing. And yet, as heartbreakingly amazing as Julianne Moore is in this film (as evidenced by her shiny, new Oscar), her performance still pales in comparison to the gutting brilliance of &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt;’s Emmanuelle Riva (who lost the Best Actress Oscar to Jennifer Lawrence a few years ago). But I guess Julianne Moore wasting away before our eyes gets more butts in seats than an old, naked, scared French lady played by an actress no one has heard of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about perspective, and no one knows that better than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Timbuktu</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I will admit I knew next to nothing about Timbuktu prior to seeing Abderrahmane Sissako’s film. For me, it was just the place the evil butler tried to send the kittens in &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;. I certainly had no idea about its past as a hub of Islamic language and culture. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember when it was briefly taken over by the Maghreb arm of al Qaeda, which brings us to the events depicted in the film. All I knew going in was that it was about a town that gets taken over by jihadist militants. I was expecting it to be brutal and depressing. What I saw instead was a beautifully crafted portrayal of life under extremist control. I knew a bit about the Big News Story of occupation and liberation, but the film gave me a closer look at the smaller picture (which I think might be the more important one), and the ways in which people confront the loss of the smallest freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central plot follows Kidane, a guitar-strumming cattle herder and his family who live peacefully in the desert, beyond the reach of the militants. Of course, they don’t &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; beyond that reach for very long. While Kidane and his family are the heart of the narrative, the rest of the characters are every bit as compelling, even those who are only in one or two scenes. Though we don’t see more than a couple of brief moments in their lives, they stayed with me long after the film ended. Your long takes and frequent use of close-ups afforded the actors near-total command of my attention, from the girl glaring in sullen defiance at members of a Sharia tribunal, to the misery and regret on the face of a young jihadist as he briefly recalls his former life as an aspiring rapper. I say &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt;-total command of my attention because I can’t ignore the profound impact the film’s other visual and stylistic elements had on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a film about people rebelling at every opportunity, from the subtlest of expressions to outright defiance, against the constraints forced upon them. I feel like you were in lock step with these many tiny rebellions. The militants in the film spend a lot of time droning on and on about everything that is forbidden, and it’s a long bloody list. But for every forbidden pleasure, we see a character indulging in it. And you aid and abet the townsfolk by infusing each shot with colour and beauty. No bright clothing allowed? Boom - voodoo priestess parading through town in vivid blues and reds with a pet chicken and zero fucks given. Football is forbidden? Cut to kids joyfully kicking an imaginary ball around. No music allowed? Secret midnight jam session captured with a sense of intimacy and romance that would most certainly not fly with the ‘Chef Djihadiste’. Not everyone gets away with their acts of defiance, and here we see the kind of cruelty of which the jihadists are capable. Mercifully, you don’t dwell on these images. We all know how brutal their ‘justice’ is. We don’t need to see it play out in any detail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film uses a gentle yet unyielding touch in underscoring the absurdity of the jihadists’ attitudes and actions. That it also uses humour to this end was surprising, and one of the things that makes &lt;em&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/em&gt; unique. There are moments of flat-out mocking - I noticed you frequently had a donkey wander in and out of the shot whenever the jihadists approached. Well played. But there are also moments of softer derision that treat their targets with grace and empathy. ‘Jihadist doing tai chi in a trance’ isn’t something I ever thought I would see, and it makes no sense at all. It’s ridiculous and we all have a good laugh at his expense because (in the words of my companion),“fuck that guy”, but it is also one of the most serene and beautiful moments in the entire film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the film isn’t all that optimistic. French and Malian forces would drive the jihadists out within a year, but I couldn’t help thinking about all the other places and people who continue to struggle under the control of Islamist extremists. You could have easily clubbed us over the head with the mindless cruelty and destruction wrought by such groups but I, for one, am glad you chose to go with a hopeful reminder that while extremist ideology may exert control over one’s body, the spirit puts up one hell of a fight. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Two Days, One Night</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;“Too slow” is a complaint I often overhear when leaving a theatre after a film. “Nothing really &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt;” is another. I heard both immediately after seeing Jean Pierre and Luc Dardenne’s &lt;em&gt;Two Days, One Night&lt;/em&gt;. I didn’t say anything, but had I chosen to stop and drop some film geek wisdom on that total stranger, I would have pushed my glasses up the bridge of my nose and informed him that the film’s slow pace and deceptively simple plot actually complement an ambivalent, complicated narrative that unfolds far quicker than they realized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Friday evening, factory worker Sandra is informed that she is to be laid off. Her boss grants her one last chance to save her job; She is given the weekend to convince her colleagues to vote for her to remain at the factory, the catch being that in doing so they must forego their own bonuses. Faced with her family’s financial ruin and battling her clinical depression with some highly inadvisable over-medicating, Sandra spends her weekend calling on each of her co-workers, pleading for their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if viewed as a simple character study, the film is well worth the price of admission. Marion Cotillard makes it impossible to take your eyes off Sandra, even when you feel compelled to look away, as though that would somehow spare her the slightest amount of shame and humiliation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I said before, there is so much more going on. You set a pace that matches Sandra’s demeanor at the outset of the film: somnambulistic and hesitant. However, it allows us to really feel Sandra’s desperation build. Given the episodic feel to Sandra’s encounters with her co-workers, a more rapid or frenetic pacing would have made the plot feel repetitive quite quickly. Instead, there is a cushion of time in between plot points that allow the viewer to contemplate the film’s bigger questions and issues; Between Sandra and her colleagues, some in even more dire circumstances than hers, who is more deserving? What is the likelihood that Sandra keeping her job will mean someone else losing theirs? What kind of shitty boss pits his staff against each other like that?! How would &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; vote? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the heavy political concerns raised by the film, I wouldn’t have been surprised if you had gone for a more hard-hitting, crowd-stirring approach in the editing room. But this is a Dardenne Brothers film, not &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt;. Come Monday morning, Sandra will either get to keep her job—by now a hollow victory—or be turned out by her peers. She will not find her inner Norma Rae, and there will be no “I am Spartacus” moment right before the vote. Instead, you allow the highs and lows of the plot to gently flow into an elegant and poignant conclusion, as though you shared my need to see Sandra retain or regain at least a modicum of dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
