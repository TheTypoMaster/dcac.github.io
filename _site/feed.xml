				<title>We Need to Talk About Adam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a 13-year-old-boy, ignore this letter. Carry on with your Xboxing and your YouTubing or whatever it is you kids are into these days. But if you have pubes, and a fully developed prefrontal cortex, you also have some explaining to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who the hell are you, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to figure you out for years. When I picture you in my head it’s not pretty. I see monobrows, Cheeto-dusted sweatpants, and Crocs. I imagine too many digits and not enough teeth. I realize this sounds horribly condescending, especially because I was once one of you. But that was a long time ago. Clinton was president. Napster was a thing. Adam Sandler was funny. I was high. Pretty much all the time. But even now, when the most mind-altering substance I imbibe is Tazo Calm tea, I still think &lt;em&gt;The Wedding Singer&lt;/em&gt; is funny. Everything he’s done since then would require me to ingest Chris Farley-levels of recreational pharmaceuticals to find even mildly amusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So really, who are you? I’ve asked around and no one will readily admit to being an Adam Sandler fan. But you must be out there. It’s kind of like how everyone likes to hate on U2, yet their massive stadium shows sell out in minutes. Someone’s going, but nobody wants to cop to it. Like that barbed wire tattoo you thought was cool for twelve minutes in ‘99, if you can hide it now why wouldn’t you? And I can’t say I blame you. Admitting you like Adam Sandler’s films means admitting to yourself what you know deep inside must be true: Adam Sandler thinks you’re stupid. He thinks you’re sexist, and racist and borderline sociopathic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least it seems that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why else would he continue to make sophomoric drivel set in a Hooters, or in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citypress.co.za/entertainment/movie-review-tired-offensive/&quot;&gt;Africa rendered so insulting and full of stereotypes&lt;/a&gt; that he might as well have just shot it at The Rainforest Cafe? Why would he keep playing the same sad-sack Everyman with a bullying streak and an uncontrollable temper? It’s because he thinks you’re a bunch of mouth-breathing rubes who will happily pay to see whatever insipid dreck he deigns to shart out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of sharting, Adam Sandler movies can best be compared to the McRib; they both come around about once a year surrounded by inflated hype, they’re molded into a pre-formed shape with the cheapest material, are completely devoid of nutritional value, and they cover you in shame sweat immediately following consumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also make an inexplicably obscene amount of money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast food chains don’t make food as much as they sell &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-three-types-of-adam-sandler-movies/&quot;&gt;Sandler operates in much the same way.&lt;/a&gt; To him, comedy isn’t art, it’s commerce. Like McD’s, he succeeds because he keeps operating costs low thus ensuring a high return on investment. His movies aren’t movies, they are units sold. Quantity versus quality. His goal isn’t to make millions of people laugh, it’s to make a few people rich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Sandler stopped trying years ago. He admits as much himself. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avclub.com/article/adam-sandler-confirms-his-movies-are-just-paid-vac-204952&quot;&gt;His films are an excuse for him and his friends to get a paid vacation&lt;/a&gt;. Which wouldn’t be so sad if his movies were even marginally funny. Instead they take aim at the marginalized. His style of comedy isn’t just lazy, it’s mean. And it’s mean &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it’s lazy. The easiest, cheapest laughs are the ones you get from punching down, from harvesting the lowest hanging fruit. They aren’t effortless, they are effort-free. There is no subtext, no hidden metaphors, no subtlety whatsoever. Chicago Tribune’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/adam-sandler-has-finally-hit-the-limit-of-satire/391550/&quot;&gt;Michael Phillips nailed it&lt;/a&gt; when he said, &amp;quot;People of color, to say nothing of women, who have been marginalized, patronized or humiliated by a stupid joke in an Adam Sandler movie over the last few years constitute the biggest club in modern Hollywood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for some reason, you’re all still laughing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, a group of Native American actors walked off the set of Sandler’s latest cinematic abortion, &lt;em&gt;Ridiculous 6&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/23/native-actors-walk-set-adam-sandler-movie-after-insults-women-elders-160110&quot;&gt;They had been told the movie wasn’t racist, and that the production had hired a Native consultant.&lt;/a&gt; They went ahead in good faith that their culture would be represented respectfully. But once on set, they raised several concerns (inappropriate character names and costumes to name a few) which were summarily dismissed. It would have been bad enough if they &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; had to endure a bunch of people “whitesplaining” what should and shouldn’t offend them. They were then told by producers, “If you’re overly sensitive, you should leave.” Netflix, the company behind the film, released an overly defensive statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason: because it is ridiculous. It is a broad satire of Western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of — but in on — the joke.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make one thing crystal clear: Adam Sandler wouldn’t recognize satire if it shat in his mouth. But it’s no surprise Netflix is going to stand firm. Last fall they inked a four (!) picture deal with Sandler (who approved of the union, saying &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-signs-adam-sandler-to-a-4-year-movie-deal-2014-10&quot;&gt;Netflix rhymes with “wet chicks”&lt;/a&gt;), and they aren’t necessarily in the same financial position that bigger studios like Disney and Sony are to weather the kind of box-office stinker that &lt;em&gt;Ridiculous 6&lt;/em&gt; is destined to be, let alone endure three more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Sandler himself has remained mum on the incident. But his co-star &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/vanilla-ice-on-ridiculous-6-this-movie-isnt-dances-with-wolves-20150427&quot;&gt;Vanilla Ice has leaped to the film’s defense&lt;/a&gt; stating, “I’m part Chocktaw Indian” which is the Native equivalent of saying “I can’t be racist, I have a black friend.” If this was Sandler’s idea, maybe he does have a sense of humour after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, you have a few options, you can admit you’re a horrible person who has helped to line the pockets of a self-loathing, man-child because you also think poking fun at the disenfranchised is the height of comedy. You can admit you’re a stupid person, because you think jokes like, &lt;a href=&quot;http://defamer.gawker.com/these-are-the-jokes-that-caused-actors-to-walk-off-adam-1699990455&quot;&gt;“Say honey, how about after this, we go some place and I put my pee-pee in your tee-pee?”&lt;/a&gt; are funny and you just can’t be bothered to try harder because thinking hurts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you can admit that admiring an entitled 48 year-old millionaire doofus who wears cargo shorts and ballcaps is embarrassing, grow the fuck up, and finally make an appointment to get that barbed wire tattoo lasered off. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Unfriended</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Remember that gag in &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; with Luke Perry analogue Kyle Darren, as a teen heartthrob whose face transforms into a sea of wrinkles when he smiles?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tip my hat to you for being able to avoid the embarrassing spectacle of an actor desperately trying to convince the audience they&amp;#39;re years younger than they appear by casting people who actually resemble high school students. It adds a nice feeling of authenticity, and if there&amp;#39;s one thing I can give &lt;em&gt;Unfriended&lt;/em&gt; major props for it&amp;#39;s the use of actual search engines and social media sites; nothing ridiculous like FaceParty or YouSearch. Since the entirety of the action unfolds within a teenage girl&amp;#39;s computer monitor as she juggles a Skype group chat with her friends while scouring the internet for advice on how to deal with the vengeance-minded spirit of a former classmate, it&amp;#39;s important that everything feels as real world as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pretty novel and cool twist on the incredibly tiresome found-footage conceit, and I&amp;#39;ll be honest by saying I was actually kinda anticipating this. Unfortunately, once you take away the flashy window dressing, almost nothing about&lt;em&gt;Unfriended&lt;/em&gt; works at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, I&amp;#39;m a sucker for revenge stories. Few things satisfy me more than seeing the baddest of the bad receive their much deserved comeuppance. The idea of a girl driven to suicide only to return and punish her tormentors is a pretty solid one, but the way the film executes it feels incredibly confused and problematic. For better and (mostly) worse, you were able to find actors who could hit all the requisite levels of superficiality, despicability, and selfishness I imagine are present amongst many in that age bracket. However, even though it is revealed that our protagonists were somewhat complicit in the events leading up to Laura&amp;#39;s death, nothing about their systematic bumping-off holds any real emotional resonance. They aren&amp;#39;t callous enough for their deaths to feel justified and satisfying, yet on the flipside they don&amp;#39;t even come close to being likeable enough for us to feel sad about what&amp;#39;s happening to them. It all feels pretty hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing as the shenanigans are kicked off by a humiliating video of Laura being posted online, I must commend the filmmakers for having the good taste not to adopt a ripped-from-the-headlines approach and have the footage contain a sexual assault. That said, the video basically amounts to nothing more than Laura getting blackout drunk and having an accident. Embarrassing to be sure, but going on to torment her friends feels oddly unearned. Even more eyebrow raising are the implications that in life Laura may have herself been a bully and her conduct could have been far more egregious than those of her victims&amp;#39;, despite her near endless moral postulating (&amp;quot;You all deserve this, you&amp;#39;re all terrible people&amp;quot;, etc). Other than a minor twist or so towards the end, we have people being punished for basically leaving mean comments on YouTube, and an antagonist whose righteousness completely falls apart under the slightest scrutiny, despite the way the film handles her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what about the scares, you may ask? I must admit that some of the death scenes are well done and even a little disturbing due to how unexpectedly graphic they are, but even then they&amp;#39;re severely undercut by the ludicrousness that follows. For instance, after witnessing the horrifying death of one of their friends, the survivors proceed to spend what feels like an eternity screaming, &lt;em&gt;screaming&lt;/em&gt; at each other over relatively minor secrets the ghost forces out of them. C&amp;#39;mon guys, big picture. You can argue over who totalled whose truck later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate horror that tries to address real life issues, but &lt;em&gt;Unfriended&lt;/em&gt; is just a mess on nearly every level. That said, you do have a good eye for age-appropriate casting so hopefully your services will be called upon for the next teen-centric horror exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Far From The Madding Crowd</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In some ways your book &lt;em&gt;Far From The Madding Crowd&lt;/em&gt; could stand as a proto-feminist manifesto. In other ways, important ways, it is an antecedent to some of the worst melodrama know to humanity. That the two things come together so artlessly in the 2015 film adaptation of your novel is unfortunate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iteration of &lt;em&gt;Far From The Madding Crowd&lt;/em&gt; begins well. Your awkwardly named protagonist, Bathsheba Everdene, is fiercely independent and, thanks to a timely inheritance from a doting uncle, beholden to no one. For a woman to be propertied and untethered to any man was a rare circumstance at the end of the 19th Century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the rest of the story is a tangled web of contrivance involving three different Harlequin Romance archetypes. The quiet, self assured cowboy (in this case a shepherd played by Matthias Schoenaerts) the moneyed but damaged bachelor—Michael Sheen, of course—and even a faithless cad of a soldier, played by Tom Sturridge. As the story progresses it becomes hopelessly, and pointlessly, labyrinthine. A film that could have been a fascinating examination of class and gender in Victorian England devolves into a series of romantic mishaps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names of Bathsheba’s suitors betray a kind of on-the-noseness that is present throughout the narrative: Gabriel Oak as the Shepherd, William Boldwood (I’ll bet it is) as the aging bachelor and Sergeant Troy as the philandering gambler in soldier’s clothing. Even the date of the original publication doesn’t excuse this clumsy wordplay, since there are far too many novels that come from the same period—&lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; just to name two—that rise far above this kind of genre laziness. I have also seen adaptations of &lt;em&gt;Far From the Madding Crowd&lt;/em&gt; where the tone and the melodrama were circumvented in useful ways—&lt;em&gt;Tamara Drewe&lt;/em&gt; most recently. But this particular version, helmed by director Tomas Vinterberg, is entirely too self-important and earnest to finesse the more leaden aspects of the plot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the performances are uniformly competent, the film itself is beautifully shot and the source material is rich enough that it might have been used to create something far more interesting. But the film falls apart in the last two acts. By choosing to focus on the Bathsheba’s inept management of her personal relationships, Vinterberg undercuts the moments that could have elevated this beyond a high-end gothic romance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are glimpses of what would have been (at the time) seditious egalitarianism as Bathsheba mucks it up with her various employees, literally getting covered in shite—thereby confounding the Monty Python method of identifying the ruling classes. But these become throwaway moments as more and more of the film occupies itself with describing the ungainly four way relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a way to make all of this work, I’m sure. But in this instance at least part of the problem is there is far too much story packed into too little time. Either this should have been a mini-series or there should have been some editorial decisions about what the film was going to focus on, because as it exists it is neither beast nor fowl—and that confusion is fatal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptations always carry a certain peril—lose the thread and you will be crucified by the fans. Or stick too closely and you run the risk of being hamstrung by the limitations of the original text. In this case a more liberal interpretation of your source material may well have served everyone better. As it stands &lt;em&gt;Far From The Madding Crowd&lt;/em&gt; is a film that is weighed down by a story that once must have felt revolutionary, but now seems trite.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Superman v Star Wars: The Blockbuster Awakens</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Two movie trailers set the internet ablaze last week. At the annual Star Wars Celebration festival in Anaheim, director J.J. Abrams debuted the second &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; trailer to an auditorium full of eager fans. Earlier that same afternoon, in what you might call a teaser for the teaser of the trailer, Zack Snyder offered a few quick (and rather feckless) clips from &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;v Superman: Dawn of Justice&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this pageantry and playing coy is considered best practice for film marketers; trailer releases have become almost as important as the actual release of the film—and probably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; important to those opening weekend numbers than the actual quality of the film. But these two particular trailers –in the aesthetics they purport to represent and the manner in which they were debuted – are indicative of two very different attitudes towards the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster. One approach  has exhausted critics, seems to be on the brink of exhausting fans, and may soon exhaust its momentum at the box office. The other approach, rooted in the not-so-distant past, might revive the diminishing artistic returns of the major studios’ tent-pole popcorn flicks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, the two trailers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngElkyQ6Rhs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; bets heavily on nostalgia: we begin with a panoramic view of a familiar desert planetscape (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Tattooine, but a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; arid, windswept world); we get X-Wings and tie fighters; and, most notably, a Luke Skywalker voice-over and our first glimpse of retirement-age Han Solo. If you’re not a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; devotee (and no mystical energy field controls &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; destiny), much of this won’t matter to you. But if you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a fan, the swell of John Williams’ melodic strings and winds likely dried your throat, and the glimpses of your old pals Artoo and Chewie may have brought tears to your eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IwfUnkBfdZ4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;v Superman&lt;/em&gt; is a much different trailer. After Snyder’s flirtatious tweets, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/17/batman-v-superman-trailer-leak&quot;&gt;“leaked” a week early&lt;/a&gt; (who can say whether the marketing team at Warner Bros. is just incompetent, or so incompetent that they’re brilliant). It begins with the standard throb of ominous ambient noise, then gives us a little Charlie Rose voice-over (which isn’t quite as affecting as hearing Mark Hamill); then a slow tracking shot towards a shadowed statue that is revealed to be, yes, a monument to Superman with, yes, graffiti scrawled across the chest that reads: False God. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zack Snyder has never been one for subtlety. Whatever hope there had been that the influence of Christopher Nolan (who produced &lt;em&gt;Man Of Steel&lt;/em&gt;, as well as this quasi-sequel) might quell his instinct for misanthropic self-seriousness was crushed by the arrival of his misanthropic, self-serious Superman film. The &lt;em&gt;Dawn of Justice&lt;/em&gt; trailer suggests that his follow-up is exactly what you might expect from the much-maligned pop-artist: beautiful, hyper-real CGI shots that seem like moving Rubens paintings, and laughable, hyper-dramatic dialogue (“this is how it starts...the fear, the rage...the feeling of powerlessness...”). This sneak peek at this latest superhero crossover – with which DC Comics and Warner Bros. is hoping to establish an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;-style cinematic continuity – is more of the same: lots of shadows, sneering, heavy weaponry and political metaphors so broad that not even the Last Son of Krypton could leap them in a single bound. But let’s be frank: more of the same isn’t a bad thing for the bottom line. Despite being a critical disappointment, Superman’s big screen comeback grossed $668 Million worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zack Snyder may not be seeking redemption (he’s admirably unapologetic), and neither is J.J. Abrams (though some people think he should be). But Abrams faces a different challenge with his new flick—perhaps no filmmakers in the history of filmmaking has ever faced higher expectations than Abrams does as the heir to the Holy Trilogy. Online reaction to the very first &lt;em&gt;SW:FA&lt;/em&gt; teaser is proof. A pitch perfect capsule of images and sounds that elicited every good feeling about the original trilogy that the prequels supposedly forgot, and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; the naysayers found something to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this new &lt;em&gt;SW:FA&lt;/em&gt; trailer suggest about Abrams’ approach? And how does it differ, in its foundational approach to big-budget cinema, from the &lt;em&gt;BvS&lt;/em&gt; trailer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it’s important to understand why it makes sense to compare these two pictures. What makes them relative variables is the simple fact that they &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;. As recently as a decade ago, the notion of a big-budget superhero film featuring both of DC Comics’ two most iconic characters (along with Wonder Woman &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Aquaman, who are featured in a series of promotional posters, and therefore, one supposes, appear in the film—once again WB’s genius/incompetent marketing at work) would have been preposterous. Likewise, the possibility of new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films – featuring the original cast, no less! – seemed utterly implausible even just a few short years ago. George Lucas’s prequels had seemed to annihilate the franchise’s big screen ambitions (animated properties like &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt; have thrived on television and in toy aisles). That these two films are being released within a few months of each other suggests that we are reaching the crest of the sea change that began when Marvel began intermingling its characters and bundling them into blockbuster franchises. The narrative continuity that is so important to sci-fi and comic book superfans now exists in theaters. What seemed impossible is now possible. More than possible, actually. &lt;em&gt;Profitable&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about Abrams? He’s already rebooted one beloved sci-fi franchise, and, while he didn’t always get the ratio of fan service to storytelling right (says one of the fans he serviced), he resurrected the Enterprise and its crew fairly well. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; will require a defter touch, though, and if this latest trailer is any indication, Abrams may have gotten it right. And he gets it right in direct opposition to the approach Snyder takes. Optimism, positivity, clarity and, most significantly–– a palpable sense of &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; something that Hollywood seems to have completely forgotten when it comes to these types of films. What made Abrams’ second &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; flick such a disappointment was how much it felt like every other recent mega-action film: incomprehensible action, overwhelming effects, the sound and fury signifying nothing, and, worst of all, an obscenely high body count paired with imagery suggestive (almost offensively) of 9/11. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You might say he Zack Snyder-ed it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of this is speculation (and no small amount of barely-suppressed fanboy hope), which is precisely what trailers of this kind are meant to provoke. Maybe &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; will be dark and gloomy and replete with the kind of slick CGI that contradicts the gritty Old-West aesthetic of the very first film. Maybe  &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; v Superman will embrace the absurdity of a superpowered alien fighting a rich old white guy with an underground armory and a taste for cosplay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the trailers don’t suggest so. And while these little two-minute commercials the marketing department cuts together are rarely indicative of the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of the film, they tend to pretty accurately predict a film’s mood and tenor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s little doubt that &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt; will top the list of 2015’s biggest films (and with a Christmas release, might just end up being 2016’s box office champion, too). And there’s also little doubt that Abrams has made it a priority to recapture a bit of the innocence and wonder that made Lucas’ space adventures more than just films. The question is, will this return to a simpler, lighter, more positive approach to the blockbuster reverse the trend that started a decade ago with the Nolan’s first Batman film? Has the gritty reboot run its course? And is that necessarily a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good or not, it will be, in the meantime, a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>True Story</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have never believed you. On a deep, molecular level I find you utterly unconvincing. No matter what character you may be playing I find it almost impossible to accept you as anything other than Jonah Hill pretending to be some guy. So the fact that you are the deeply flawed protagonist of a film called &lt;em&gt;True Story&lt;/em&gt; is kind of problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jonah Hill Effect is far less of a barrier for me in movies like &lt;em&gt;21 Jump Street&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;This is The End&lt;/em&gt; because you are not playing a character that requires much of a stretch—either on my part or yours. All I have to do is accept the premise of you as helpless schlub (and, in the case of &lt;em&gt;This is The End,&lt;/em&gt; demon spawn) and I’m in. In &lt;em&gt;True Story&lt;/em&gt; though, your singular capacity to undermine my suspension of disbelief is reflective of the films most glaring weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Story&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the relationship between a journalist and an accused murderer. It is the kind of true crime story (like NPR’s &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; or HBO’s &lt;em&gt;The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst&lt;/em&gt;) that demonstrates a reality that ethicist Janet Malcolm delineates in her book, &lt;em&gt;The Journalist and the Murderer:&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.&amp;quot;  It is the kind of work that—if it is to be successful at all, and not simply exploitative and inherently parasitic—requires the finest sort of calibrations regarding tone and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Story&lt;/em&gt; feels most thin when dealing with its central theme—what is the space between people’s stated intentions and their actions—largely because the two central characters are not presented credibly. I don’t believe James Franco’s portrayal as accused murderer Christian Longo and I certainly do not believe you in the role of disgraced NYT journalist Michael Finkel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your performance is arid, disengaged. Your scenes with Franco feel like a table read or a workshop, completely devoid of emotional content. The performance is so mechanical and workmanlike that I feel like I am watching particularly well rehearsed community theatre, competent enough but devoid of any real emotional truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Story&lt;/em&gt;’s problems do not begin and end with casting. The choice to break the film into vignettes that are so clearly delineated make the whole exercise feel dispassionate and removed. The point of making a fictional film based on true events would seem to be about reaching some deeper truths, something that lies behind a straightforward recitation of events. But the film’s structure undermines that goal, leaving it feeling emotionally sterile and disconnected from its subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Story&lt;/em&gt; certainly strives for a kind of authenticity—using natural light and low-key performances, long takes and a general reserve in the story telling. The pallet is cold and often muted and nothing about the visual presentation is over the top. Normally these would all be points in the film’s favor but in this case they tend to underline the vacuity of the central performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the only way into this film for the audience but you are an unreadable cipher. The character you portray is the linchpin of the whole story and you just don’t give us enough to hang onto—despite the fact that, as a narrator, your character is inherently unreliable. I don’t even believe the truth of your lies, as it were. So at the end of the film all I could think was how interesting this story might have been if it had been a documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Conversation With Director Denis Villeneuve</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On the day &lt;em&gt;Sicario&lt;/em&gt; was announced as part of the 2015 Festival de Cannes’ official competition, C. Redmond speaks with the incredible French-Canadian director about his chances of winning, maintaining his signature in Hollywood, and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; sequel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to you to be accepted into Cannes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the biggest honour – it’s a massive honour for me to be part of the competition this year. Cannes is the Mecca of cinema. To see the lineup, I go there with humility because just to be part of that lineup I’m already very proud, and grateful for the invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You kind of got your start at Cannes. You worked your way from the Director’s Fortnight, and then Un Certain Regard. Did you feel it was almost inevitable that you would someday have a film in competition, or are you surprised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my dream but sometimes you feel like dreams are fading because more and more I was making movies in America. So I thought I was going away from that world of film festivals, and right now this movie that was produced in Los Angeles is a nice compliment because it’s very important for me to keep my identity as a filmmaker when I’m shooting abroad. Just to be able to keep my point of view, to stay myself. And the fact that they are inviting me, they recognize the fact that I was able to protect my identity as a filmmaker in another system of production. That for me is a big compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Coen Brothers are going to be leading the jury. Do you think that will help your odds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, strangely, I’m feeling that because we share Roger Deakins as a cinematographer, I think it makes things tougher (laughs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you talk to me about working with Roger&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Deakins? Tell me what the difference was between working with him the first time and working with him a second time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time I was much, much more comfortable with Roger. The first time I was always a bit impressed. I was feeling like a student and he’s the teacher. The second time it was more collaborative, the communication was much better. Stylistically we get along pretty well. The first experience was beautiful, but the second was better. Working with Roger, honestly, it’s rare in your lifetime that you will have a chance to work with a master. And he’s someone, even if I’m on set with him and I have to direct him, or nourish him so he’s able to create, I always feel like I’m in a learning process, because I’m learning all the time with Roger. Every shot, I’m learning something. It’s a massive privilege for me to get to work two times with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there someone you worked with on your most recent film &lt;em&gt;Sicario&lt;/em&gt;  that stood out to you as great, but might never get any media attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh boy. Yeah, I’ll give you one right now: the dolly pusher, his name is Bruce Hamme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got to be kidding! I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/10/prisoners.html&quot;&gt;review of &lt;em&gt;Prisoners&lt;/em&gt; and I wrote to Bruce Hamme &lt;/a&gt;. That’s too funny. I noticed his work.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the man. That guy is an artist. He’s the dolly grip and he’s the extension of Roger, the one who will create the dance of the camera, the one who will find the right rhythm. He’s the most precise, the way he pushes the camera is just an art form. I feel he is also the most lovely human being. Roger is using a specific crane in almost every shot, which means in almost every shot we have to build that crane, a little crane that is so precise and so delicate and Bruce is dancing with that crane all day long, and working and he never complains. And he’s the nicest human being. Bruce is definitely the one I will make an homage to, a tribute to Bruce. I could talk about him for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s perfect. I met you at the Genie Awards four years ago, and you told me your friends were making fun of you saying, “Denis, when are you going to stop making these pretentious art films and make a sci-fi film, because you know that’s what you really love”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(laughs) Exactly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now you’ve got two sci-fi films coming. Tell me how that finally happened.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in LA with &lt;em&gt;Incendies&lt;/em&gt;, all the studios were asking me, “What will you do? What would be your dream?”  And my only answer was always sci-fi, because I knew that if there was something that I could do in Hollywood that I couldn’t do at home it was sci-fi. With sci-fi you need a certain amount of resources. So I kept on saying this and at one point two young producers came with a fantastic little short story called &lt;em&gt;Story of Your Life&lt;/em&gt;. It was one of the best things that I’d read and I was like “Whoa!” this is poetic, beautiful and strong and exactly the kind of project that I would dream to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep saying I want to do sci-fi for adults, so like &lt;em&gt;2001&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;. That was always the two examples I would give that I would want to do. Or &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters&lt;/em&gt;. So with 21 Laps, a company set in LA, I developed this little sci-fi project called &lt;em&gt;Story of Your Life&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to shoot in next June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now you’re going to work with Bradford Young as a cinematographer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m going to work with Bradford Young because Roger Deakins wasn’t available this summer. He wanted to do the project but there was a scheduling conflict. So I made a long research and came into contact with that cinematographer. He’s young but he already has a strong signature. I was very impressed. I fell in love with his work quite quickly, and to my great pleasure he agreed to get on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you consider working with (cinematographer) Nicolas Bolduc again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to because I love Nico. Yeah, of course! But when you cast a DP, you cast a specific sensibility, and for &lt;em&gt;Story of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; I needed someone like Bradford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;? That doesn’t seem like it would be in Roger Deakins’ normal palate of what he does. Would you consider him for that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot answer that, but I can tell you you have the wrong instincts (laughs). It would be a dream for me to do that with Roger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(laughs) Good to know!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Are you able to talk about at all what you want to do, how you want to put your stamp on revisiting that story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a creative point of view unfortunately I can say nothing, other than that the script is pretty powerful and that it was a long decision for me to make. It was too much of a dream for me to participate on such a project and I’m aware of the massive pressure. The original &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; is one of my favourite movies of all time. I saw that movie maybe fifty times in my life. I will do my homework and I am uber excited. I wake up every morning pinching myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think there are any lessons to be taken from&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be very disappointed because unfortunately I can say nothing.  All I can say is that the script was written by Hampton Fancher, Ridley Scott and Michael Green and the three of them did very impressive work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any scripts that you’re writing that you want to do in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I cannot make a lineup of projects. For now I’m just concentrating on &lt;em&gt;Story of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; and the possibility of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; right after is enough for me (laughs). After that, I will sleep for three weeks, or three months maybe. I feel that I lined up a lot of projects one after the other and after that I will probably take a break. Just for a few months and go back on to screenwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just promise it’s not going to be as long as the break you had between  &lt;em&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/em&gt; (2000) and &lt;em&gt;Polytechnique&lt;/em&gt; (2009). We need you too much.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(laughs) Don’t worry, that’s not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Last Knights</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The vocal style you use, singing the same syllable over several notes, is called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisma&quot;&gt;melisma&lt;/a&gt;”. Its intended purpose is to provide a hypnotic, or trance-like effect. You’ve found incredible success by blending this style with electronica, hip-hop and French torch songs and yet have always managed to sound completely original. &lt;em&gt;Last Knights&lt;/em&gt; repeats so many worn out tropes, visuals, and stock characters that it too induced a trance-like effect. A kind of deja-vu that nearly sent me into a deep sleep for its seemingly seven-plus hour duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen &lt;em&gt;47 Ronin&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;King Arthur&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;Robin Hood: Men&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Tights&lt;/em&gt; then you won’t see anything that hasn’t already been done better (and blessedly faster) than &lt;em&gt;Last Knights.&lt;/em&gt; I could try to elaborate on the plot, but the one-sentence IMDb description is vague and unfulfilling enough that I figured I’d follow in &lt;em&gt;Last Knight&lt;/em&gt;s’ phoned-in footsteps and just copy/paste it here. “A fallen warrior rises against a corrupt and sadistic ruler to avenge his dishonored master.” In fact, part of me is tempted to just write this review by cribbing sentences from reviews of better sword and sandal epics. But unlike the makers of &lt;em&gt;Last Knights&lt;/em&gt;, I’m at least half interested in creating something new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clive Owen plays Raiden, who is part of an elite group of warriors in what I can only assume is some kind of alternate universe. According to Morgan Freeman’s voice over, this group was formed “during the long dark period of the Great War” and is made up of “all races, colours and creeds”, (but not all genders, unsurprisingly). These fierce fighters are sworn to protect their masters, who in Raiden’s case is Morgan Freeman’s Lord Bartok. When Gezza Mott, the fey, sociopathic Minister to the Emperor has Bartok killed and his people evicted, Raiden and his fellow warriors spend the next seven, or maybe it was eight hours of screen time trying to avenge his death.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your sound is considered part of the nebulous “world music” genre, which encompasses everything from reggae, to Inuit throat singing, and Buddhist chanting. Your inclusion as a vocalist in this film was most likely meant to lend a trans-cultural vibe, since not once do we ever really know where the film is set. Describing it sounds like I’m trying to recall details of my own kidnapping while under hypnosis: it’s mostly snowy, and grey, there are mountains and forests, and the capital looks like a heavily CGI’d Medieval Times. Perhaps the film’s pedigree (it’s a Czech/South Korea co-production helmed by Japanese director Kazukai Kiriya) contributed to its identity crisis. Or perhaps by trying to be all things to all audiences it simply collapsed under the weight of its own hubris, and no one knew which country was legally bound to put it out of its misery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard your clear and powerful voice I thought it was my own inner monologue moaning “Anhhhhhhhh...anhhh...annnnnnnhhh” in agony from hearing dialogue desperately searching for gravitas, seeing characters so flimsily drawn I could have seen right through them if the sets weren’t so poorly lit, and watching bland fight scenes so tension-free they could have been choreographed by the WWE. The only thing that might have saved this film from being a complete snooze-fest would have been some unintentional humour, but &lt;em&gt;Last Knights&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t even have the decency to be camp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Knights&lt;/em&gt; is a retrograde throwback celebrating “manly men doing manly things” that takes itself far too seriously. But through it all, your voice remains steady and true, and I welcomed it, since the only other women in the film were either crying, or whoring it up at the local tavern. I think Clive Owen’s wife might have been a twig vendor but I also might have imagined it when I went into one of the fugue states this film induced. Or maybe Clive Owen’s real life wife &lt;em&gt;really is&lt;/em&gt; a twig vendor and that’s why had to make this movie. I hope that’s the case, or else I’m going to have to get a band of rogue warriors together to avenge his honour. Any chance you’re interested in being our minstrel?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Down Here</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d like to attribute your editing skills (or lack thereof) to the fact that you were not only an editor, but a co-producer and actor as well. You played Ace, a no nonsense pimp with a total of about 12 minutes of screen time. If you can’t tell, I’m fucking with you. I’m not going to sugar-coat it—&lt;em&gt;Down Here&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t good, and your editing made it feel like I was enduring way more of it than I had to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to expect with &lt;em&gt;Down Here&lt;/em&gt;, but once I started, I quickly clued in that it was going to be long. Really long. Normally, a movie about a tortured alcoholic detective tracking a psychopath who targets young hookers and records their murders would have me itching to press play. You even have the perfect lead actor playing Detective Harris — he looks like the Trivago guy if he lived off a diet of cigarettes and fast food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the script is cheesy and its faults are emphasized by the drawn out interactions between the characters. The unnecessary extended shots of street signs, people walking and driving, facial expressions and dialogue all screamed lack of confidence. You obviously didn’t think the story was clear enough so you lingered on scenes to avoid any confusion for the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It actually got to a point where I was no longer just aware of, but &lt;em&gt;annoyed&lt;/em&gt; by how stretched everything was. A perfect example would be during our disheveled detective’s mental assessment. As he was being questioned by his doctor, I tuned out. The scene itself was only four minutes, but the prolonged use of a stationary camera and muffled audio made me feel like I was watching a medical documentary from the 80s—and considering this is where a bulk of Detective Harris’ past is revealed, audience attention is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say the only saving grace was the awkward romance between Detective Harris and Stella. How did I know that Stella had a thing for Harris? Because you fixated on her while she gave him sex eyes. I couldn’t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down Here&lt;/em&gt; has many faults but if I had to choose one as the standout, I’d nominate your editing, which was about as long as the number of search results when I typed your name into Google (71 million to be exact).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankit&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Danny Collins</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Danny Collins&lt;/em&gt; is a movie that absolutely depends upon the songs of John Lennon to make it work. That fact must have presented tremendous challenges for you, since you are not only responsible for obtaining the rights to the music used in the film, but also for helping place it within the narrative structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This soundtrack is not simply a series of secondary aesthetic choices; it is the skeleton upon which the whole film rests. Al Pacino plays &lt;em&gt;Danny Collins&lt;/em&gt; as a dissolute impression of a latter day Neil Diamond. A former folk singer turned Vegas shill, Collins finds out that none other than John Lennon once mailed him a hand written letter. This is a letter that Collins only sees—for the first time—forty years after the fact, as his career is winding down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details contained in that letter are what set the story, and your work, in motion. Lennon’s music is interspersed with the feel-good, folksy anthems that Collins regurgitates nightly to crowds of blue rinse groupies. The contrast between the two paints a pretty dismal picture of what kind of life Collins chose to pursue after his early success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Danny Collins&lt;/em&gt; often teeters on the edge of sentimentality, but is saved by three things: an understated and knowing performance by Pacino, a great supporting cast, and a script that contains enough nuance that it overcomes some pretty heavy handed plot devices. And your musical choices also help to shepherd the film through what could be maudlin nonsense to something with some occasional weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lennon’s music lends a borrowed gravitas to the proceedings and Pacino strives to earn that substance by making the character of Collins something other than the usual late-life turn around. Pacino specifically plays against type—his performance is knowing and low key. The narrative tension isn’t built upon Collin’s awakening self-awareness (he is already well aware of his failings) but rather with whether or not he chooses to engage his shortcomings in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inner struggle is an interesting echo of much of John Lennon’s later solo work, when he was trying to come to terms with who he was as a man and with his place in the world. Pacino—in a real return to form—manages to convey that struggle without it being Shakespearean in tone. This isn’t &lt;em&gt;Scent of a Woman&lt;/em&gt; Pacino; in fact it is an oddly intimate film, given its showbiz veneer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second and third act of the film trace Collins’ attempts to reconnect with both his family and his musical roots. It is here that the movie struggles most with tone, but the performances—from Annette Bening to Bobby Cannavale and Jennifer Garner, as well as a crusty turn by Christopher Plummer as Collin’s long-suffering friend/manager—really save the film from itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying themes of this film are more concerned with a grudging attentiveness than the usual forced epiphanies that Hollywood often thrives on. If Pacino, and by extension the film, echoes any particular sentiment of Lennon’s it is the idea that living is easy with your eyes closed. It is when you open them wide that it becomes complicated and messy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And worth living.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Miss Julie</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As prop hand, you’re surely familiar with the world’s most famous prop-based theory of drama: Chekhov’s Gun. The renowned playwright described the principle like this: “If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt;, written by Chekhov contemporary August Strindberg and adapted for the screen by Liv Ullmann, is a prime example of naturalism. It’s realistic, it’s a careful study of human behaviour, and, above all, it’s austere. Every prop is there for a reason. While you may not have had to provide a rifle to any of the actors in &lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt;, they will be wounded nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What starts out as an exhilarating &lt;em&gt;pas de&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;deux&lt;/em&gt; of two desperate people bringing each other to the height of ecstasy and the depths of despair, things eventually grow tiresome. If you had hoped for a light summer job to supplement your regular gig of doing prop work on &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, I’m sure you were soon wishing you had signed on for that Carrot Top movie instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; takes place at a Baron’s estate during Midsummer Night in 1890. The Baron’s valet, John, is engaged to the pious cook Kathleen, but must fend off the amorous attempts of the Baron’s daughter, Miss Julie. Throughout the course of the night, John and Miss Julie will enter into a dangerous affair that will have fatal consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ullmann is no stranger to cinematic tragedy. As one of famed director Ingmar Bergman’s muses, Ullmann starred in many of the legendary Swede’s films – &lt;em&gt;Cries and Whispers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Scenes From A Marriage&lt;/em&gt;, to name a few – all of which examine themes of class, faith, and redemption. As a director (&lt;em&gt;Faithless&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sofie&lt;/em&gt;) Ullman has often explored complex relationships between men and women. Strindberg’s study of a strong-willed aristocratic woman and an ambitious servant dancing between repulsion and desire would seem the perfect vehicle for Ullmann. And it is—almost to a fault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a few noticeable exceptions, &lt;em&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/em&gt; is filmed mainly in the kitchen of the estate, which must have made your job easier. Unfortunately the static nature of the sets and the cinematography make it difficult for the film to overcome its stage origins, and threatens to undermine the naturalistic conceit. Thankfully, three very skilled actors are able to transcend these boundaries and deliver performances that are alternately heartbreaking, explosive, and agonizing. Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell, as Miss Julie and John, take turns seducing and rebuffing one another, all to the point of physical and emotional exhaustion. But it’s Samantha Morton as Kathleen who steals the movie with her understated despair. As the moral center of the story, Kathleen might be a woman scorned, but she’s never pitiable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like your dedication to filling Tyrion Lannister’s wineskin, most of your job here involves drinking vessels. In an early scene in which Kathleen serves John lunch, he asks for his wine in a crystal glass. Later, when Miss Julie orders John to serve her a beer, he pours it into an earthenware mug. These class distinctions are constantly at play. After their affair is consummated and Miss Julie realizes she is a ruined woman, John shuns her by saying that intimacy between the working class doesn’t mean anything, but for the aristocracy, it means &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every scheme to save reputations is marked by one of the characters pulling out glasses from the cupboard and something dark and alcoholic from a dusty bottle. Here is where your skills must have been seriously tested. You no doubt had many a conversation with the script supervisor before each take to determine exactly how much alcohol needed to be in each goblet. While watching Chastain and Farrell treating each other so brutally day after day, were you ever tempted to switch their fake wine with the real stuff? Did you secretly long for a stiff drink yourself? I know after more than two hours of watching their bleak struggle I was begging for some relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the third act, a pouch of money and a straight razor contribute to a tension already heightened by lust, loathing, and, of course, alcohol. It’s only a matter of time before these props bring the entire depressing scenario to an unsurprisingly grim conclusion. Ullmann tries to soften the rough edges by making the film look like a glowing 19th-century oil painting, and should be commended for her ability to draw out such tortured and raw performances. But as the film plods its way to its foregone and ugly conclusion, it seems she just didn’t know when to put it out of its misery. It’s a shame you couldn’t have handed her Chekhov’s gun. Or Tyrion’s wineskin. &lt;/p&gt;
