				<title>2014 Silver Stamps</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Readers,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chasing awards is a fool’s errand. Just when you think AIDS is the new cool, ALS comes along and throws a bucket of ice water (and quantum physics) on your head. The lesson? Keep it fresh. Up the ante. No one wants to be last year’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our motto for the Silver Stamps. We can’t keep beating on the same ol’ &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt; drum every year (though we would if we could). So here’s a brand-spanking-new list of winners and losers who helped define the last year in cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2014 Awards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Film Based on Good, Hard Science&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/19/particle-fever.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Particle Fever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Film Based on Good, Hard Fantasy&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/1/guardians-of-the-galaxy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Film Inspired by Cosmology&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/1/the-theory-of-everything.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Theory of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Has any major filmmaker of the last two decades followed a stranger and sadder path than Peter Jackson? It seemed as if his journey from schlock-horror cult director to the godfather of digital spectacle was going to be analogous to the one taken by the stalwart band of hobbits in the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy. But it turns out that Jackson is more corruptible man than incorruptible hobbit. Like Prince Isildur, he’s been seduced by unlimited power. In this case, the power of the pixel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see why Jackson might identify with those hairy-footed Shirefolk: he comes from a small, out-of-the-way place (New Zealand), he’s pretty hairy himself, and he made a name for himself by accomplishing a seemingly unconquerable task: making epic high-fantasy relevant in a post-9/11 world. When &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2003, Jackson seemed destined for membership in the modern pantheon of cinematic deities alongside guys like James Cameron, Ridley Scott, and, of course, Steven Spielberg. I wasn’t the only who had high expectations. But Jackson’s directorial output, since then, has provided exponentially diminishing returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;King Kong&lt;/em&gt; was bloated, visually overindulgent, and just barely managed to retain a bit of the sweet sentimentality that made &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lord of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rings&lt;/em&gt; more than just geek-bait VFX-porn. &lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt; was likewise bloated, visually overindulgent, and awash in near-diabetic levels of that sweetness. So Jackson, seeking firmer ground (one supposes), returned to the scene of his past successes: Middle Earth. But upon his return it seems he has forgotten some of the basic tenets of filmic storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new Hobbit trilogy, which concludes with &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies&lt;/em&gt;, Jackson’s once-lovely floating camera has become unmoored. It plummets and spins and turns sickening spirals around tiny digital figures surrounded by unintelligible spaces and incalculable masses of moving objects. Shooting characters small in the frame can be, when used sparingly, a dramatic way to establish scale. But the camera, here, remains at such a remove, and the frame is filled with such incomprehensible digital chicanery, that sitting through these films feels akin to watching a friend hack and chop his/her way through increasingly cluttered levels of a slick-looking video game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, no, you’re right, Akshay: making pejorative comparisons to “being like a video game” is a lazy way to frame the complaint. But even though video game cut-scenes have appropriated the language and rhythm of film (visual images shot by a subjective virtual camera, edited together to form a narrative sequence), films shouldn’t look like cut-scenes; in games they serve as a narrative bridge from one controllable moment to the next. In mainstream gaming, no mater how well-crafted or compelling, the narrative is still subtext: interactivity is the primary text. In film, what we see and hear onscreen is the primary text. And when what we see and hear onscreen is this shallow, this indistinct, this two-dimensional (oh, the irony!), it feels less like an interaction with a piece of art than it does a &lt;em&gt;Clockwork Orange&lt;/em&gt;-style sensory resilience test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&lt;/em&gt; the worst offender of these new films? Not necessarily. But if I’m going to defend the &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;-like nested endings of &lt;em&gt;ROTK&lt;/em&gt; by arguing that the entire trilogy is one long tale told in three chapters, and that the resolution(s) of that final film are perfectly in scale with the scope of the story that preceded it, then I must also treat these new Hobbit flicks as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’m happy that Jackson has had a chance to reunite with his old pals. Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Orlando Bloom—they’ve all returned to reprise their roles, despite the fact that none of them (with the exception of Gandalf) actually appear in Tolkien’s book. The presence of these familiar faces is justified by paper-thin subplots that Jackson and his writing team have cobbled together from the deepest of Tolkien deep cuts—which speaks, I think, to his desperation to recreate the magic of the first three films. Poor Blanchett looks particularly embarrassed to be back: Galadriel was always the most supernaturally composed of the trilogy’s regal figures, but in this latest film she’s just another strutting action hero, appearing briefly in a superfluous fight sequence that also, laughably, features 92 year-old Christopher Lee flipping and spin-kicking like a Tekken avatar being controlled by your hyperactive little brother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[I feel sorriest for Orlando Bloom, though, who is ostensibly playing a centuries-younger version of himself, yet looks as worn and swollen as Jackson’s increasingly unimpressive shots of armies cresting hilltops at magic hour.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about Peter Jackson, we should be talking about him as a peer of Christopher Nolan, not as a peer of Michael Bay. But judging his place in the spectrum of contemporary filmmakers by these last three movies, he’s erring heavily towards the latter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Akshay, why am I telling you all this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing IT support for the vast array of interconnected computers required to design and render this dog’s breakfast of orcs, trolls, goblins, eagles, bats, elves, dwarves, caribou, hogs, castles, villages, mountain strongholds, neo-brutalist fortresses, and oceans of gold coins is no small feat. It’s a thankless, taxing job. But it isn’t necessarily an &lt;em&gt;influential&lt;/em&gt; job. There’s a good chance you’ve never even met Peter Jackson. Which is why you’re perfect for this mission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need you to get some friends together. Some food, too (might I suggest a calorie-rich ethnic bread?). And some supplies (rope, mithril). You’re going to undertake a vital, perilous task: to venture into the heart of Wellington, New Zealand – to the headquarters of WETA Digital – and press CTL+ALT+DLT on the entire system. It is an evil fate, yes. You will be expected to find a way where the great ones cannot or dare not go. But when all seems lost, when all bonds of fellowship are broken, just remember: even the smallest person can change the course of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Canada’s Hottest Filmmaker is Making a Hollywood Movie — and a Classic Mistake</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Xavier Dolan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop! Please, I beg you. Stop before it’s too late. Don’t make your next film. At least don’t make the one everyone’s talking about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get it. Your career has never been hotter. Your films have never earned more praise. There’s never been a better time to make your English-language Hollywood debut. Casting news is coming out almost daily, and people are excited. They &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be exited. The names you’re attracting are a dream team of female talent: Jessica Chastain, Susan Sarandon, Kathy Bates. Yet all I can do is cringe. I’m a huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/11/7/mommy.html&quot;&gt;fan of your films&lt;/a&gt; and an unabashed supporter of Canadian cinema—which is why I’m crushed by a sense of déjà vu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every director dreams about making a Hollywood film. Bigger budgets, bigger stars, bigger audience. Which is totally understandable. But time and time again, celebrated Canadian filmmakers don’t just make Hollywood films—they make films &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; Hollywood. And they tend to suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denys Arcand started the sorry trend with &lt;em&gt;Stardom&lt;/em&gt; (2000), a looping, messy, fish-eyed look at overnight success starring a then-unknown Jessica Paré (a.k.a. Megan Draper on &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;). Two years later, Deepa Mehta took a crack at mainstreaming her career with &lt;em&gt;Bollywood/Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; (2002), which was set in Canada (and also featured Paré), but tried to have its curry-flavoured apple pie and eat it too. Soon after, Don McKellar was inspired by meeting Haley Joel Osment on a red carpet and followed-up his fantastic, distinctly Canadian directorial debut &lt;em&gt;Last Night&lt;/em&gt; (1998) with the lousy and forgettable &lt;em&gt;Childstar&lt;/em&gt; (2004). Not to be outdone, Atom Egoyan looked south to break his own self-imposed filmmaking curse by casting Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth in the showbiz period piece &lt;em&gt;Where the Truth Lies&lt;/em&gt; (2005), which today is remembered (if at all) only for the threesome scene that temporarily earned the film an NC-17 rating. And this year the Godfather of Canadian Cinema David Cronenberg comes out with &lt;em&gt;Maps to the Stars&lt;/em&gt; (2014), which has been a box-office disappointment, considering the cast, but revered by at least some critics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you’ve announced &lt;em&gt;The Death and Life of John F. Donovan&lt;/em&gt;. The plot synopsis: “an American movie star finds his correspondence with an 11-year-old actor exposed, prompting assumptions that begin to destroy his life and career.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m scared, man. History is not on your side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just Canadians who have a hard time making films about Hollywood. &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; does. There’s scarcely a film this side of Robert Altman’s &lt;em&gt;The Player&lt;/em&gt; (1992) that is even worth mentioning. &lt;em&gt;The Artist&lt;/em&gt; (2011) would be an exception: a black and white ode to the silent era, which, ironically, sounds like it could only have been pulled off by Canada’s Guy Maddin (it was actually a French film by Michel Hazanavicius). But skewering the already absurd just doesn’t seem to pay dividends to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, another Canadian filmmaking trend you could follow. Fellow Quebecois directors Jean-Marc Vallée (&lt;em&gt;Dallas Buyers Club&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt;), Philippe Falardeau (&lt;em&gt;The Good Lie&lt;/em&gt;), Ken Scott (&lt;em&gt;Delivery Man&lt;/em&gt;) and Denis Villeneuve (&lt;em&gt;Enemy, Prisoners&lt;/em&gt;) are all making a real go at it stateside, creating interesting genre films that are still thematically linked to (or, in Scott’s case, a direct remake of) their projects back home. To varying degrees, it seems to be working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re better equipped than most to make larger-than-life characters connect with an audience. Heightened personal drama is your bread and butter. So I have no doubt you’ll get incredible performances from your A-list stars. And at age 25 (dear God), chances are you’ll get a couple of cracks at it even if this film doesn’t pan out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because you’re so young, you need to know that this project is much higher risk than you think. It’s not your fault – it’s hereditary. I’m begging you: please don’t repeat the sins of your forefathers. After all, we’re counting on you for the future of &lt;em&gt;Canadian&lt;/em&gt; cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Exodus: Gods and Kings</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At the very least, they got &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; right. In a film that is tonally flat and visually bloated, you’re pitch perfect: jealous, capricious, and inscrutable. Old Testament God as genocidal child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott has always been one of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; directors, the kind whose films you see simply because they’re involved. Or perhaps he &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be one of those directors. Because &lt;em&gt;Exodus: Gods and Kings&lt;/em&gt; is a mess. It’s a film marred by uneven pacing, a wasted cast (Sigourney Weaver has three, maybe four lines), and long stretches of monotonous exposition. Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, the leads, feel like expedient choices, as if Scott had to sell the idea to the studios rather than pick the actors who would work best (in fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewrap.com/exodus-director-ridley-scott-explains-controversial-casting-decision/&quot;&gt;he’s admitted as much&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, perhaps, if biblical epics are simply prone to this kind of weird mixture of hubris and lazy storytelling. It has permeated the genre almost from the very beginning. The cultural ubiquity of the core stories, even when married with spectacle, can’t quite cover up the gossamer thin characterization and laughably sloppy plot contrivances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of like the source material when you really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the single redeeming feature for me, Yahweh. Your brief, enigmatic interactions with Moses are sharp and interesting. They give &lt;em&gt;Exodus: Gods and Kings&lt;/em&gt; a narrative focus that is otherwise lacking throughout the film. There is a chemistry between you and your initially reluctant prophet. For a few moments we see something resembling real human emotion on screen, even if it comes from a pissed off pre-teen deity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not the case in the rest of the two-plus hours of this particular Ridley Scott production. He has had a pretty good track record picking his leads, but his last three or four films – &lt;em&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/content/2012/6/12/prometheus.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/content/2013/11/7/the-counselor.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Counselor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – have all seemed slightly miscast despite the star power each of them boast. Here it’s no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott, like much of the Old Testament work you inspired, depends a great deal on conjuring a sound and fury that ultimately signifies nothing. Why bother making this film? It’s just a limp, episodic re-telling of a familiar story bereft of any motivating force—there is simply no THERE there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the bible without belief, a myth that doesn’t revel in it’s own fantasy. Unlike Aronofsky’s &lt;em&gt;Noah,&lt;/em&gt; which clearly saw God as metaphor rather than immanent – more Spinoza than Augustine, if you will – this film doesn’t really take a stance one way or another. Your depiction as an impatient, powerful adolescent sits in a weird vacuum since the rest of the movie doesn’t reflect that sensibility at all. Which is too bad, since that might have been a film worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead Scott seems to have borrowed from your playbook: neglecting narrative discipline for a kind of meandering hodgepodge of contradictory and incoherent exposition, then trying to pull it all together with a big ending. An ending, which while beautiful and awe inspiring, is ultimately empty. None of it means a thing if you lose us in the first act. And I just didn’t buy it from the genesis.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fading Gigolo</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite things about listening to vinyl records was poring over the back of LP covers looking for familiar names. I was always pleasantly surprised when famous musicians lent backing vocals or guitar licks to a friend’s album, like John Lennon on Bowie’s &lt;em&gt;Fame&lt;/em&gt;, or Nile Rogers on the Vaughan Brothers’ &lt;em&gt;Family Style&lt;/em&gt;. I imagined that these mates jamming together gave the songs a relaxed, loose vibe. Sure, the songs weren’t necessarily the artists’ best work, but you could always feel the love coming through the speakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same thing can be said of John Turturro’s &lt;em&gt;Fading Gigolo&lt;/em&gt;. He brought a lot of friends to the jam session and they didn’t hit all the notes, but the result was still kinda catchy in spite of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turturro plays Fioravante, a mild-mannered florist having money issues. His best friend Murray proposes he pimp out Fioravante to his doctor who is interested in having a threesome Soon Fioravante has built up a clientele, but falls for Avigal, the widow of a Hassidic Rabbi which leads to a cacophony of moral conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I’m curious if you met John through the Coen brothers. You’ve both worked for them so many times it would seem likely that you’ve run into each other on occasion. Turturro turned in many iconic performances like the titular &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt;, and the scene-stealing Jesus in &lt;em&gt;Big Lebowski&lt;/em&gt;. Your job was to secure musical clearances for &lt;em&gt;No Country For Old Men&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inside Llewyn Davis&lt;/em&gt; to name a few&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The Coen’s music is just as carefully considered and executed as their characterizations of men pushing at the boundaries of their existence. Similarly, the choices you made for the music in &lt;em&gt;Fading Gigolo&lt;/em&gt; are deliberate and evocative. Standards like Dean Martin’s &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt;, playfully sexy tango numbers, and original jazz compositions all add to the lush world Fioravante inhabits. It’s a shame that Fioravante just lays there dead on the page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never learn enough about Fioravante to be truly invested in his journey. The interplay between he and Woody Allen’s pitch perfect Murray sounds like a well rehearsed duet. When Murray turns Fioravante out a little too easily and without much resistance, Turturro misses a chance to show us some of Fioravante’s depth. Instead, he rushes headlong into his role as unconventional lothario and the arms of Sharon Stone’s unfulfilled Dr. Parker. They slow dance to a soft jazz selection, which showcases your curating skills and Dr. Parker’s vulnerability, but leaves Fioravante a dull mystery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music, as with the earthy set design, and the elegantly textural jewel-toned costuming, create a rich and sensual backdrop that make up for the flat characters and the somewhat improbable plot. We’re never exactly sure why Fioravante falls for pious Avigal, or why Murray sets them up in the first place. Luckily, watching a talented cast – including Vanessa Paradis, Liev Schreiber, Sofia Vergara – wander through New York City accompanied by songs from jazz greats Dalida and Gene Ammons isn’t entirely unpleasant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit I’m not a big jazz aficionado, but I’ve learned that the best way to enjoy it is to just let it waft over me like a warm breeze. When I do that, there doesn’t need to be an obvious structure, or beginning, middle and end for me to appreciate the assembled components. I felt the same way watching this film. If I tried too hard to find the melody I might have missed out on some inspired solos, yours included. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Third Person</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A good love story is hard to beat. So the promise of three separate yet intricately connected love stories must be even better, right? That’s what Paul Haggis promises us in &lt;em&gt;Third Person&lt;/em&gt;, a film that follows three couples in Paris, Rome, and New York. The initial draw is wondering how everything will tie together in the end. Which is great, except that the “twist” is given away quite early in a bit of ham-handed dialogue, leaving us with a meditation on the fictions we create and what – and who – we choose to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is anchored by Michael, an author struggling with his new book, and his muse/protegé/lover Anna, who toy with each other&amp;#39;s hearts and minds in a Paris hotel. In Rome, grumpy American Scott meets the mysterious Monika, a Roma woman trying to rescue her daughter from a human trafficking ring. And in New York, Julia struggles to rebuild her life while battling her ex-husband for custody of their son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I picture the storyboards you created for the film, I see roughly-sketched panels that place characters where they need to be, indicate what they’re  and doing what they need to be doing at various points, without getting into any detail as to who they are, who they will become, or what motivates them. At that point in the process, they might just be stick figures or vague, featureless shapes. The fleshing out of the characters comes much later. Or at least it&amp;#39;s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first act places everyone at a blank, dead-eyed starting point. Once we are sufficiently informed that everyone is sad about something, connections start to develop, and relationships are established. I began to be slightly charmed by some of what was taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway through, it feels like someone abruptly realized the characters &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be sad and angry, and the witty banter and flirting suddenly lapses into silences that I imagine are supposed to be brooding and/or pensive, but are really just flat and uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time each character has a Big Emotional Climax, it doesn&amp;#39;t quite fit with how they have developed thus far. Haggis knows where he wants his characters to end up, but the sudden shift from subtle, slow-burning character study to overwrought, hysterical dialogue and action is too jarring to make their journey engaging. The film goes from quiet contemplation to high melodrama so fast I was left wondering what the hell just happened. The plot twists feel like cantaloupes thrown at my head by someone yelling, &amp;quot;Here is a shocking twist! Be shocked now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters do and say a lot, and there are a few moments in which you see a glimmer of chemistry or life, especially in the Michael-Anna relationship. But for all the heavy-handed dialogue and over-the-top emoting, they remain the fleshless, featureless figures in a storyboard panel that merely serve as bland points of reference and scale for the image being constructed. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Babadook</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The best genre films are never by-the-numbers. They employ the comfort of convention as a way to explore deeper issues. Sci-fi, for example, is always richer as allegory. The most piercing comedy is often the simple result of tragedy plus time. Yet horror films are too often satisfied with immediate, visceral thrills—the kind of generic cinematic experience a “casual” director might be satisfied delivering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Babadook&lt;/em&gt; proves that Jennifer Kent is no casual director. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny, then, that she hired two “casual” ADs for this film. That word, both in North America and Australia (where &lt;em&gt;The Babadook&lt;/em&gt; was shot) can of course have multiple meanings. Perhaps you were only there on a part-time basis. After all, the film doesn’t feature any big international stars and was made for a modest 2 million. But “casual” also has more negative connotations: from unplanned, to superficial, to indifferent. None of which apply to the filmmaking I witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Babadook&lt;/em&gt; is a careful and considered entry into the crowded supernatural thriller genre. It can “casually” be described like a thousand other films: a mother tries to convince her child that the monster he is seeing in their house isn’t real—until, of course, the sinister force becomes too powerful to deny. As an entry point, that might be all the audience needs. But I hope you, at least, realized that the premise is actually an excellent way to explore PTSD, grappling with grief, and the pressures of being a single parent. None of that sounds too sexy for the poster, but in the same way the Babadook monster is explained through a hand-made pop-up kids book, the very menacing truth behind the message is what makes the film so haunting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also must have taken note, even in your cursory position, that Kent had structured her screenplay like an exorcism film, but made it secularized, and, ultimately, internalized. This evil-within-us approach is much more chilling, and brilliantly reinforced by one of those inexplicable news reports about a mother’s murder-suicide with her children. That simple injection of a familiar real-world horror story makes the fear very personal and much less outlandish that it could have been. In fact, the slow-burn of the film’s first act, devoid of any scares (earned or cheated), establishes believable characters in a recognizable world, all of which enhances the more fantastical events of the the following acts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two central performances by Essie Davis and the seven-year-old Noah Wiseman are easily the most memorable aspects of the film. But they’re also serviced by the perfectly atmospheric low-light cinematography, the rigorous art direction (with a strict adherence to moody colour palettes), and the subdued sound design that never once gives us cat-jumping false alarm jitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe your position makes sense. I can see how, after making a short film based on the same story almost a decade ago, Jennifer Kent might hire a couple young aspiring directors for her first feature film, sit back, and casually say: “Don’t worry. I got this shit.”&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Corner Gas: The Movie</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Executive producers are usually one of two things: a dude or dudette with a bag full of money and lots of notes (often about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgYhLIThTvk&quot;&gt;the necessity of giant spiders&lt;/a&gt;), or someone spiritually invested in the project. I absolutely believe you are more the latter than the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a labor of love for you. A project that you care deeply about. The affection among the returning cast and the sheer exuberance of the performances are impossible to deny. And if good intentions and a willingness to mug endlessly for the camera are enough to bring to life a film that feels like it was based from a rejected Gilligan’s Island spec script, I would happily accept it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m old enough to have watched a lot of two camera sitcoms during the 70s and 80s. You must remember them as well, because &lt;em&gt;Corner Gas: The Movie&lt;/em&gt; feels like one of those “very special episodes” that often portended the cancellation of one of those shows. And no amount of crane shots or wide angle fades of Saskatchewan sunsets will change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the episodes I’m talking about. The ones where little Kirk Cameron discovers he’s just a bit different than everyone else, or where Todd Bridges is confronted with – and defeats! – the demons of drug abuse. That kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie runs for ninety minutes, though it might have been put to better use as the last three episodes of your long running series. When your oft-repeated cultural reference is Ted Danson – even when the anachronism of that reference is ostensibly the joke – you should realize that the well you’re plumbing has run pretty dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also – this is going to read as bitchy – but &lt;em&gt;for the love of God&lt;/em&gt; if you’re shooting in HD in mid-summer Saskatchewan sunlight, please no close-ups. Even watching on my computer monitor, I was horrified. I can’t imagine what it would look like on the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though one of the few redeeming features of the series is that everyone is, to put it politely, one of us – Brangelina need not apply – combining poor cinematography with layers of stage makeup that looks like it was intended for a red carpet and not for unforgiving natural light actually made me turn away from the screen a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason it is called magic hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things just don’t translate. Some TV shows were meant for the small screen and nothing else. I don’t doubt that the whole cast and crew are charming, funny people, but none of that is evident in this big screen version. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d very much like my ninety minutes back. Or you could just send me the grant money set aside for &lt;em&gt;Corner Gas: The Movie 2&lt;/em&gt; and I’ll make a doc about grain elevators—which, sensibly, I’ll only shoot only between the hours of 7:30 and 8:30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Serena</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Logging is dangerous business. You’ve no doubt heard (or even seen) your fair share of logging horror stories. It would seem that the people who are able to make a successful career in the industry are aware of the risks, and can anticipate a potentially hazardous situation by taking the proper precautions. But hiring an experienced crew and choosing a reliable base of operations isn’t always enough. Sometimes, despite the best efforts, the unthinkable happens, and it leaves everyone wondering how things could go so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serena&lt;/em&gt; is just that kind of tragedy. One that could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 1929, and George Pemberton is in danger of losing his Smoky Mountain timber empire after the Black Tuesday stock market crash. While back home in Boston, he meets and marries the mysterious Serena, the daughter of a late lumber baron. Together they return to the Smoky Mountains and must resort to desperate measures to keep from losing their company and their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the Czech mountains stand in for the Smoky Mountains of the American Carolinas. But I can’t imagine that early twentieth century logging camps differed that much from one another: a few hastily built cabins for operations, barracks to house the men, some stables, long dirt roads that lead to the cutting sites. Your particular area of expertise involves cableway extraction, where winches and cranes are used to move the massive logs down the mountain. Early in &lt;em&gt;Serena&lt;/em&gt;, one of these cranes fails, gravely injuring a worker. George leaps into action to save another worker. If this is meant to demonstrate his heroism, it doesn’t quite square with the same man who summons a young woman from the cookhouse to his quarters for some after hours logjammin’. Endemic throughout the film are George’s conflicting traits, which are meant to add dimension, but instead lead to exasperation—and, ultimately, indifference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serena herself first appears astride a white horse. To say Jennifer Lawrence is perfectly cast to play Lady Macbeth-lite gives the film too much credit. She is just so frighteningly talented that at this point audiences would probably accept her playing Batman. And she would kill it. When she arrives at the basecamp on George’s arm, they’re greeted by a very pregnant cookhouse girl. Serena sums up the situation and coolly dismisses her. She very quickly proves herself equal to any man in the camp, training an eagle to catch snakes, showing the men how to properly angle a cut, and saving the life of the camp scout. It’s easy to see why Buchanan, George’s right hand man, feels edged out and plots to give up the cooked accounting books to the sheriff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I bet you’d welcome such a remarkable woman at your logging operation, wouldn’t you? It’s too bad, then, that Serena devolves from a confident and complicated female lead into a film trope generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she has a miscarriage, then learns that George has been supporting his illegitimate child, she becomes unhinged. She convinces George they need to dispatch of anyone that might destroy what they’ve built (you know, because women are crazy). But this is probably because, as a child, she lost her whole family  (you know, because orphan women are even crazier). The last act of the film sees characters confessing, running from peril, and sustaining brutal acts of violence. There’s also a government land-grab subplot and a panther-as-hunter/prey metaphor to fill in the blank spaces on the narrative-device bingo card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J-Law’s tween fans will likely be put off by &lt;em&gt;Serena&lt;/em&gt;’s dreary pacing and unrelenting doom. Director Susanne Bier’s fans will be especially disappointed by the story’s lack of focus and abrupt character development, flaws absent in her far superior films like &lt;em&gt;After The Wedding&lt;/em&gt;, and In &lt;em&gt;A Better World&lt;/em&gt;. The look of the film is typical Bier, though: moody and sparse, with faces shot like landscapes, gorgeously lit by moonlight and candles. The score is particularly haunting and evocative. The cast – Bradley Cooper, Toby Jones and Rhys Ifans, and, of course, Lawrence – is exceptional.  That’s why it’s so frustrating that the film’s core elements, though carefully conceived, are undermined by the anemic script adapted from Ron Rash’s novel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just a shame we couldn’t see the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Penguins of Madagascar</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your career trajectory sort of came out of left field, didn’t it? Not only are you the voice actor for Skipper the penguin in &lt;em&gt;The Penguins of Madagascar&lt;/em&gt;, the latest spin-off of the Madagascar franchise, but you’re also the writer of the original film. It’s certainly not every day that the folks who toil on the screenplay get to voice characters in the movie they’re working on! And, even if they do, so far as I can tell it has never before been the case that their minor characters became so popular that they got their own movie and TV series. Kudos must also go to Chris Miller, Christopher Knights, and Conrad Vernon — the voices of the other penguins — who have likewise contributed in very different ways: as story artist, first assistant editor, and creative consultant on the original film, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how you all accomplished this achievement, aside from the fact that the penguins in the Madagascar movies are truly entertaining, not least of all because of your voice work. So, congratulations (even if every actor who has studied the craft of voice performance for years might secretly fantasize about squishing your head for achieving success by such a sideways path)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re lucky, too; this movie is actually far better than the last entry in the franchise, &lt;em&gt;Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted&lt;/em&gt;, which featured returning stars Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and David Schwimmer (my apologies: I know you co-directed that one). What was a major weakness in that film — its randomness and lack of a solid story structure — actually works in the favour of such madcap characters as the penguins. It may have been a highly implausible story, but it nonetheless elicited a continuous chorus of giggles from the children surrounding me in the theatre (and from myself, let’s be honest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go forth and enjoy the creation of &lt;em&gt;Madagascar 4&lt;/em&gt;, which I see is already in the works for 2018. Maybe next time, you can find a best boy or a grip to add to the voice cast? I’m sure they’d appreciate it (though I’m sure they’ll never be abled to top Werner Herzog’s delivery of “bumbum” in the opening narration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;
