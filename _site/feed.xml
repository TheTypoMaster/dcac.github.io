				<title>Tim&#39;s Vermeer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Was it nepotism or necessity that got you the job on &lt;em&gt;Tim&amp;#39;s Vermeer&lt;/em&gt;? Given your relationship to the subject, my guess would be a bit of both. But I get the feeling your husband, the titular Tim, only handed you the camera as a last resort when the crew wasn&amp;#39;t around. Turns out, &lt;a href=&quot;http://leslietuckerjenison.com/&quot;&gt;you&amp;#39;re an artist yourself&lt;/a&gt;. A quilter. And a rather renowned one. You&amp;#39;ve been in numerous publications, shown your work internationally, and in addition to curating shows and writing several books, you also run workshops as a &amp;quot;fun-cilitator&amp;quot; (which frankly sounds exhausting). Being completely consumed by an art form is likely something you understand better than most. If anyone could empathize with your husband&amp;#39;s obsession, it&amp;#39;s you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely you knew Tim was a bit of an eccentric when you married him. Having designed a program that renders 3D images for film, his interest in Vermeer&amp;#39;s ability to paint photorealistic images that he describes as, &amp;quot;seem(ing) to glow like an image on a movie screen&amp;quot; goes beyond mere fascination. How is the verisimilitude of Vermeer&amp;#39;s work light years ahead of his 17th century contemporaries? This is the puzzle Tim is determined to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim&amp;#39;s Vermeer&lt;/em&gt; shares similarities with other recent art-mystery docs like &lt;em&gt;Who The #$&amp;amp;% Is Jackson Pollock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;My Kid Could Paint That&lt;/em&gt;, both of which dare to question the perceived truths held dear by art world elites. Tim&amp;#39;s suggestion that Vermeer could have used lenses and a variation of a camera obscura in order to achieve the near photographic precision of his paintings isn&amp;#39;t popular, nor is it new. Architect Philip Steadman and artist David Hockney both seem to think Vermeer had some help, citing that lenses were the cutting edge of technology in the 1600s. But when Tim, who is not a painter, decides to recreate Vermeer&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Music Lesson&lt;/em&gt;, I was reminded of another singularly obsessed genius, Philip Petit from the doc &lt;em&gt;Man On Wire&lt;/em&gt;, whose enthusiasm, like Tim&amp;#39;s, is both contagious and unsettling. Over the course of five years, Tim learns Dutch, visits Vermeer&amp;#39;s studio in Delft, then recreates it in a warehouse in San Antonio. He grinds lenses, designs exact replicas of furniture and props in &lt;em&gt;The Music Lesson&lt;/em&gt;, learns to make oil paint using the same materials Vermeer would have used, and starts painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet you were glad you had your quilting to keep you busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an artist, did you enjoy the opportunity to pick up a camera and focus on something a little more technical? Or did you discover, as your husband did while recreating one of the most revered paintings in the world, that what he was doing wasn&amp;#39;t subjective but objective? Filmmakers (magicians and proud skeptics both) Penn and Teller are the perfect people to stitch the pieces of this mystery together, and they balance the elements of art and technology handily. From an emotive, whimsical score that never condescends, and lighting that lives up to the high standards of Vermeer&amp;#39;s mastery of light, the film hits almost all of the right notes. The only thing missing was you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn that not much is known about Johannes Vermeer, and strangely, the film doesn&amp;#39;t tell us much about Tim either. Your three daughters were involved in the film (one produced the film and another sits as the model for the painting), but they don&amp;#39;t provide any observations about their dad. We only see you once, in a college photograph of you and Tim. Like the &lt;em&gt;Girl With A Pearl Earring&lt;/em&gt;, you too are a cipher. Then again, the film isn&amp;#39;t called &lt;em&gt;Tim&amp;#39;s Wife&amp;#39;s Vermeer,&lt;/em&gt; is it? But your insight into the man who decided to devote half a decade of his life to such a strange hobby would have been welcome, much like the batting in between the layers of your quilt that, instead of just joining the pieces together, provides much needed warmth.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Discussion with Jake Paltrow, Director</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt; opens in the theaters nationwide, C. Redmond talks to writer/director Jake Paltrow about what he learned from working on P.T. Anderson&amp;#39;s first film, how he communicates with each department on set, and what&amp;#39;s it like to have his godfather, Steven Spielberg, show up at his film premieres.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You come from a family of Hollywood professionals â€” but what made you personally want to get into the business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young person I was very interested in special effects and practical effects. I was very interested in creature creation and monster makeup, sort of in the mold of Rick Baker. As a pre-teenager, that&amp;#39;s really what I wanted to be. Then I learned as a young teenager that I didn&amp;#39;t really have the artistic skills to do that. You know, the sculptor or the painter was such a big part of all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing that occurred as a side effect of that interest was making shorts, or sort of scenes built around some of these effects. You know, bullet shots, monster masks, something that would create a brief narrative for something I was creating. Out of that came the interest in actually making movies. So my interest really stemmed out of a horror background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get into directing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school a teacher got me interested in the French New Wave, and the American cinema of the 30s and that really was a big eye-opener for me. When I was 19 I made a short film, but I got into actually working in movies as a production assistant. First on TV shows, then on some movies. I started travelling around the country working on these different projects with some of these assistant directors that would take you along with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I was dead set on making a short film as soon as possible, and at the time I&amp;#39;d gotten a grant from Kodak to do that, so I think I got five thousand feet of 35mm film, which at the time was a very meaningful thing. The resolution alone kind of set you apart as a professional versus an amateur because of the look. That&amp;#39;s gone now, because there&amp;#39;s an equality of material now, but at the time having 35mm film in itself was a big deal. I made a short and it got into Sundance and got a little attention, and I got offered my first TV show to direct from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was really how I got into TV, because it wasn&amp;#39;t a primary interest, even though my father had been in television. But it was an opportunity to be a professional and that&amp;#39;s how I looked at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You were a Production Assistant on &lt;em&gt;Hard Eight&lt;/em&gt;, Paul Thomas Anderson&amp;#39;s first film. What did you learn being on that set?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, I feel like I probably learned everything on that one. More so than on all of the other ones. It was a very small group and everyone became very close sort of right away. It was made quickly in Reno, and most people were living in the casino and I was living in a hostel nearby or something. It was very easy to tell how talented Paul was and what a great environment he created in making the picture. For me, it was really the model of how to do it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and how to do it right. It was very convincing. At the end of the day, we all watched dailies together and the results were patently good. It was a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you learn from directing TV? How has that informed your work as a feature film director?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really thought of them as too different. I always just approached them through my own interest or personal experience or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain shows are very rigid, and have a sort of rigid aesthetic, so you go along with that. Sometimes that produces a less interesting final result, because maybe it feels less and less like you. There are shows where you&amp;#39;re ultimately more of a senior technician on crew, or you may not even be the most qualified person to really be doing it. Really the producers and the crew themselves could fashion together some sort of self-regulating system of directing a show when it&amp;#39;s a very rigid aesthetic and you&amp;#39;re cranking out over twenty episodes a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A show like Boardwalk Empire is the complete opposite. There&amp;#39;s no mandate for coverage and they&amp;#39;re really pushing you to just bring your artistic sensibility to their show and they want that. They want it to feel different, and I think that&amp;#39;s something inherent at HBO and really fostered by those great producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about making your first feature film, &lt;em&gt;The Good Night&lt;/em&gt;. You obviously had a great cast in that film with your sister Gwyneth, Danny Devito, Penelope Cruz, and Martin Freeman. What were some of the lessons you took from that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a great experience. We made that in London. We certainly had more time than we did on this one, and I think the environment for independent movies at that time - and it was sort of a low-budgeted movie but I remember feeling like we had plenty of time to make it even though it was 37 days or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that&amp;#39;s pretty good for a drama, no?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, it&amp;#39;s very good. We made (&lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt;) in 35 days, and it&amp;#39;s basically a visual effects movie. It has 200 or something visual effects shots and you&amp;#39;re doing it very, very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been somebody who plans everything as much as I can. I think for me I&amp;#39;ve learned to guard the process better from that experience. I think there are certain departmental things that I have maybe more control of now, or look out for earlier, so that we don&amp;#39;t end up with any snafus later on. I won&amp;#39;t single out any particular department, but there are things that I felt like I let slip through the cracks from the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that was a function of coming from television where the departments are much more well versed in what these things need from the director, so you&amp;#39;re getting delivered stuff that&amp;#39;s so good that you don&amp;#39;t even have to think about. A movie is created top to bottom, so there&amp;#39;s less of a machine that&amp;#39;s in place and more that you have to build from scratch. I think that we definitely did that in South Africa but we did it quite successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about some specific departments on this film and how you worked with them to achieve your vision. Starting with the camera department and cinematography.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t really talk specifically about any real references for the movie except a movie called &lt;em&gt;Silent Light&lt;/em&gt;, Carlos Reygadas&amp;#39; movie about Mennonites in Mexico. We only talked about the lensing. They were using a sort of older Russian anamorphic lens that is very inconsistent and it sort of brought a compression, but it brought a real look to it just in the lensing of the movie that I really responded to. So that was something that we wanted to mirror in &lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I&amp;#39;m very dedicated to working on film, and so is Giles (Nuttgens, the cinematographer). That&amp;#39;s something we really see eye-to-eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re very close collaborators, so we sort of build an idea of what we want it to look like, but not in an imposed way. We&amp;#39;re paying very close attention to what the environment is like and trying to get a very naturalistic representation of it but one that also feels heightened in a way. There&amp;#39;s no filtration, the colour correction process is so minimal, we virtually do nothing. It&amp;#39;s more of a colour balancing probably, or image balancing than it is a true colour correction. We don&amp;#39;t add contrast, there&amp;#39;s none of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people really get into the DI (digital intermediate) suites and start dialling in colours and creating a saturated look and that sort of stuff in post. We really are approaching it as a film-based process, really going from what film itself does so naturally and so well and trying to preserve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your approach to art direction in the film?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to explore the idea of a future of regression, regressive technology. In some ways, even though we have robots, the technology by which they&amp;#39;re living has sort of reverted to an analogue state. So it&amp;#39;s like HAM radios, absolutely no television, everything is sort of done on radio or CB, and that extended to the car. So we really approached it from a Cuba 1959 way of how one day everything just stopped when the embargoes were piled on and you have to make do with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sort of thought of (&lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt;) as an aesthetic from the mid-1990s. It was the end of cars being more mechanical than electrical. We really tried to approach it from a practical standpoint of how would all these things still be working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of informed by the world as well, it&amp;#39;s regressive in it&amp;#39;s social mores, regressive in the roles of women in certain ways and those were all things that we tried to mirror in the environment, and it&amp;#39;s a very distressed world in every kind of way. And how do you reflect that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That applies to the costumes as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. A lot of their clothes are, you know the idea of rationing, of food being delivered, but also some of those clothes are delivered. Some of the clothes are colour coded for men and for women, and why would that be? Possibly because in areas of conflict, law enforcement would have a very quick idea of who were women and who were men by the clothes. It&amp;#39;s all about the undershirts. If you&amp;#39;re in T-shirts and you&amp;#39;re giving men blue and women pink which are very clichÃ© obvious colours, but if you look at it from a law enforcement place, where they&amp;#39;ve had protests in the past, you very quickly have a sense of how many men or women you&amp;#39;re dealing with. Those sorts of things that are all integrated even though we don&amp;#39;t necessarily flesh them out narratively. Those are just the ideas we were talking about all through the process of building the movie from top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why the film feels like it has a certain colour palette, those things were all sort of built in, we like to approach them from some sort of edict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what about the editing? You have a lot of long dissolves here, almost like an old Western .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that process was quite intuitive. Even though the performances were naturalistic, I wanted the movie to feel quite storybook. It was very inspired by the S.E. Hinton novels. Even though they have a naturalism to them, they also feel sort of storybook and nostalgic. That was something I wanted to mirror. So the chapter headings and the long dissolves, to me, made it feel more storybook. It makes it feel like this is a tale that can only be told as a film. Maybe it was adapted from a book, maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t. But it feels like a movie. There&amp;#39;s no sort of Cassavetes realism to it, and that I liked. I wanted it to feel fictional, I wanted it to feel storybook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the sound design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a part of the process that I really love. In a lot of ways, the mix is one of the times when I&amp;#39;m most relaxed. When hiring a sound mixer, I wanted them to be very flexible and very mobile in terms of the mic-ing. Most of all the production sound was very usable, which was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julian Slater, who is the sound designer and mixer and everything was recommended to me by Edgar Wright, who is a friend. I was talking to him about how we wanted to create this unusual environment. So I said who is the sort of Ben Burtt in London? And he recommended Julian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hired Julian ultimately, and he has an understanding of sound that feels real but takes a tremendous amount of invention to get there. So there&amp;#39;s a real artistic quality to the elements that he&amp;#39;s creating for the movie. Really iconic sounds. I always loved the way Indiana Jones&amp;#39; pistol has such an iconic sound the way it&amp;#39;s shot. It&amp;#39;s not the way the gun sounded - it&amp;#39;s less of the realistic &amp;quot;let&amp;#39;s record that sound&amp;quot; than come up with something that feels our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Julian I feel did that many times from the gunfire, to the way that things reverberate, and the voices in the house - he just came up with very iconic sounds. And he mixed it so beautifully. Getting to hear the movie in a theatre with really great sound is one of the really wonderful experiences I hope people will find in the theatre there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You brought up Indiana Jones, so I have to ask...your godfather, Steven Spielberg, was at the Sundance premiere of your first film, and this film as well. Do you welcome the kind of attention that brings, or do you feel like it adds pressure to how the film is received? And do you feel any extra personal pressure having one of the greatest filmmakers right there beside you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean for me it&amp;#39;s obviously a very exciting thing and you know, he&amp;#39;s a great friend and somebody who I am lucky enough to get to show a cut of this movie to before it&amp;#39;s finished. I think he has a small group of people that he does that with and I feel very lucky that I&amp;#39;m one of them, really. He&amp;#39;s been a great friend and I feel very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Young Ones</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a moment early on in this film where I realized you had lost me. During the slow reveal of an ad hoc water pumping station in the middle of the desert, all I could think was: that is not a water pumping station, it is a movie set inhabited by people pretending to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting as a John Ford morality tale set in a fading civilization, &lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt; utilizes a complex narrative structure, where each act follows a different character. I think I understand what you and director Jake Paltrow were reaching for, but perhaps it was one sub-genre and two characters too many. It feels like all of the various aesthetic and narrative points of reference that the major participants value are woven together, but instead of a beautiful quilt you get an orange and green plaid sweater with one too many arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt; is also defeated by its own ambitions. A film largely populated by naturalistic actors, it still attempts to create a mythic narrative. The sets are minimalist yet rich in small detail, but the natural landscape is breathtaking to the point where everything in front of it seems contrived and out of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the quiet, subdued performance of Michael Shannon and a film that is intentionally stagey and constructed (each act is announced by onscreen titles) fails to create the hoped for tensions, undermining both the actors and the plot device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say there is nothing to admire here. Shot on film and in Namaqualand, Northern Cape, South Africa &lt;em&gt;Young Ones&lt;/em&gt; is sometimes overwhelmingly beautiful. There are moments of real friction as well, although they all come as a result of interactions with Michael Shannon and he doesn&amp;#39;t see nearly enough screen time. The rest of the cast honestly feels too callow and one dimensional for the weight they have to carry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production design fell short as well. While I enjoyed the cleverness of the mechanical donkey and some of the bits and bobs of the kind of regressive, analog universe you builtâ€”like shortwave radios and a distinct absence of iPhones and their iCousinsâ€” it still felt like an invented world rather than an inhabited one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would still rather watch a hundred films like this than a lot of other, less ambitious works that only aspire to product creation. But there are some really weak spots: the women characters particularly are reduced to narrative pivots and little else. Elle Fanning was utterly wasted in this film, and even when she was active in a scene she seemed to flail to find her place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe if everyone had dialed down their ambitions and found a crisper, more defined focus for the story the film might have matched its potential. I&amp;#39;m sorry Sharon, but I was hoping for more.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Top 5 Most Terrifying Scenes in Movie History</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelan Young writes postcards to the cast and crew responsible for some of the most frightening moments in movie history.&lt;/em&gt; (WARNING: Spoilers ahead)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5. The Hallway Scare in &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist lll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Gerry Fisher, Cinematographer,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be opening myself up to controversy by saying that, for the most part, jumps are among the cheapest tricks horror movies can pull. Whether it&amp;#39;s a hissing cat suddenly leaping out of a closet/cupboard/fridge, everyday noises cranked up to eleven for no discernible reason, or characters who greet one another by stealthily creeping up from behind and pouncing, it can be startling, sure. But rarely scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[A perfect example of this is the moment in &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; when Homer bursts into Bart&amp;#39;s bedroom in the middle of the night to show off his brand new hockey mask and chainsaw.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bring us to what is arguably the most famous scene in otherwise underappreciated &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist lll&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes it special is how unassuming the setup is. You set up a perfectly still shot of a hospital hallway while a nurse does her rounds. She leaves the frame to enter a patient&amp;#39;s room, comes back into the shot after about ten seconds, then, suddenly, the stillness is horrifically broken. You zoom forward, the soundtrack shrieks, and a figure shrouded in white comes out of the room behind her holding a pair of shears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s absolutely hair-raising, and the immediate cut to a shot of a decapitated statue informs us of the poor woman&amp;#39;s fate without actually showing a drop blood, which is pretty ingenious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/M7Yu8jCrJeg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4. Testing The Blood in &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Rob Bottin, Special Makeup Effects Creator and Designer,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every great thing that can be said about your astonishing work on &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt; has already been said. Even now, thirty years later, the effects you created to bring to life one of the all-time most frightening screen monsters haven&amp;#39;t aged a day. Contrary to the claims of some naysayers that argue the film relies too heavily on gloopy makeup, the film&amp;#39;s most effective, suspenseful scenes are those in which your makeup and design works perfectly hand-in-hand with the very smart, well-constructed script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this more evident than in the infamous blood testing scene. The steady undercurrent of paranoia has reached critical levels as &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; camp leader MacReady is forced to kill in self-defense, then designs a test to determine once and for all who is human and who isn&amp;#39;t. The tension builds superbly as one by one the survivors are cleared, until MacCready&amp;#39;s attention lapses at a crucial moment and the Thing reveals itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is a nightmare of melting flesh and snapping jaws. It&amp;#39;s truly marvellous stuff. I have yet to meet anyone who didn&amp;#39;t jump out of their skin when they watched this sequence for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/hqVbOSEsJNo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Stuck in the Tunnel in &lt;em&gt;The Descent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Shauna Macdonald, Actress,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes &lt;em&gt;The Descent&lt;/em&gt; such a marvel is that, long before the ill-tempered Gollum-creatures arrive and turn the whole thing into a monster movie, it functions equally well as a breathlessly suspenseful cave exploration/survival story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also remarkable that for all the blood that is spilled, the single most chilling moment in the film comes when your character gets stuck in a narrow tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never really considered myself claustrophobic, but the discomfort and panic you convey as the situation becomes more and more dangerous is so palpable, so &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt;, that...well, I&amp;#39;m pretty hardened when it comes to the horror genre, but of all the times I&amp;#39;ve watched &lt;em&gt;The Descent&lt;/em&gt; (which is a lot) I&amp;#39;ve never been able to keep my eyes on the screen when this scene comes up. And that&amp;#39;s primarily due to your incredibly powerful performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. The Attic Finale in &lt;em&gt;REC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Javier Botet, Actor,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s difficult to emphasize how profoundly disquieting the last few minutes of &lt;em&gt;REC&lt;/em&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, the entire third act is the ultimate &amp;quot;how could it possibly get worse?&amp;quot; scenario, as nearly the entire cast is abruptly (and mercilessly) bumped off and the possibility of a happy ending fades ever further into the distance. And then we get to the attic, where you finally step in front of the camera, and we find out it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get worse after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother. Of. God. It isn&amp;#39;t enough that the makeup and design is ghastly â€“ a skeletal body topped off by a head that seems entirely too large â€“ but add to that your half-hunched posture and awkward, jerking movements. It&amp;#39;s those disturbing physical elements of your performance that convert the last few minutes of this film into high-octane nightmare fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/BrmpbVPTDCw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. The Last Shot of &lt;em&gt;The Vanishing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Tim Krabbe, Screenwriter,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a storytelling standpoint, the finale of The Vanishing is pure macabre gold. After years of fruitless searching, the film&amp;#39;s protagonist finally establishes contact with the man who abducted his girlfriend, who then offers to reveal her fate. Great, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both your book and in the screenplay you adapted from it, you perfectly capture the banality of evil in your characterization of Raymond, the abductor; he&amp;#39;s a mild-mannered, painfully ordinary individual who is nonetheless completely devoid of empathy and, as he explains to the hero, has carried out an unimaginable crime just to prove a point to himself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumstances Rex finds himself in at the end of the film...it&amp;#39;s truly difficult to think of any other scene that has left me as rattled as this one. The concept is fairly simple, but utterly terrifying in the way it&amp;#39;s executed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s even more amazing is the way you sprinkle clues throughout the film about how everything will resolve, most notably in an early scene when Saskia recalls a dream about floating golden eggs. The awful moment of realization when the meaning of that dream becomes clear, which comes &lt;em&gt;right before&lt;/em&gt; the credits roll, is indicative of the power of genre cinema. It&amp;#39;s one of the bleakest, and most terrifying, moments in film history. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Before I Go To Sleep</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your resume is a veritable list of British cinema&amp;#39;s greatest hits: &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare In Love&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dirty Pretty Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Queen&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The King&amp;#39;s Speech&lt;/em&gt;â€”just to name a few. Your still photographs are used as reference material for production, promotions, and, in this case, as props in the film. Even though you&amp;#39;ve shot some of the most famous people in the world for some of the most renowned producers and directors, your job doesn&amp;#39;t really change. In fact, you were the only person behind the camera of this film who was actually &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to deliver a predictable product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I Go To Sleep&lt;/em&gt; is yet another wannabe sex-thriller with the kind of maddeningly vague premise that studios love because it gives the audience absolutely nothing to go on, thereby nullifying any expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine wakes up every day with no knowledge of her past. As she struggles to piece together her existence, terrifying memories start flooding back and she begins to fear the very people she is supposed to trust. If I didn&amp;#39;t know any better, I&amp;#39;d imagine someone pitched &lt;em&gt;Before I Go To Sleep&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;50 First Dates&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt; (right before they cackled like a hyena and slammed an eight-ball on the conference table). Unfortunately for &lt;em&gt;Before I Go To Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, audiences have been trained to ferret out the surprise twist in every suspense flick made since Haley Joel Osment got hair in his bathing suit area. And these days they&amp;#39;re savvy enough to know that the plot holes shouldn&amp;#39;t be bigger than the twists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your work shows up early on. Christine awakens, as she does every morning, scared and bewildered beside a man she doesn&amp;#39;t recognize. Fleeing to the bathroom, she sees a photo collage of herself and the man in happier times. I was confused too, mostly because I couldn&amp;#39;t understand why Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth were in a Lifetime movie. Your photos told us the story of a couple who were once in love before &amp;quot;the accident&amp;quot; caused Christine&amp;#39;s amnesia. We see them, smiling adoringly on their wedding day, smiling adoringly on vacation, smiling adoringly in a park. They looked just like the pictures that come with the frame when you buy it, and, sure enough, their characters turn out to be just as flimsy. Kidman&amp;#39;s perpetually open-mouthed confused-face runs the gamut from &amp;quot;Did I leave the oven on?&amp;quot;-concern to &amp;quot;Did I leave the oven on?&amp;quot;-panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Colin Firth just looks like he wants to slide back in that picture frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there&amp;#39;s a camera hidden in a shoebox in the back of a closet, and of course Christine finds it. Her doctor calls her every morning to remind her to take it out and film herself in order to build up a memory bank of sorts that she uses to replace her missing long term memories. At this point I was wishing I had lost my long term memory, too. That way, the shots of the dank underground parking lot, the Kubrickian hotel hallway, and the desolate industrial park with the creepy mannequin warehouse would have seemed fresh and inspired. Like I expected, this film has many questions, like: &amp;quot;Does Christine have a secret child?&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Can she trust her husband or her doctor?&amp;quot; and, most important to me, &amp;quot;Am I going to remember any of this movie before I go to sleep?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not unusual for someone in your line of work to go through several rolls of film (or SD cards, I guess) trying to get the one shot you need. When I was a model very briefly in the pre-photoshop days, a photographer made me jump off the same fence post repeatedly in order to get that &amp;quot;perfect shot.&amp;quot; He told me officiously: &amp;quot;A great picture isn&amp;#39;t taken, it&amp;#39;s given.&amp;quot; As my tired body involuntarily launched itself off that wooden perch for the hundredth time, I remember thinking, &amp;quot;What a jag-off.&amp;quot; But now I kind of get it. Sometimes you have to do the same thing over and over in order to achieve a desired result. But what&amp;#39;s the point of doing something that&amp;#39;s already been done if you can&amp;#39;t do it better?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>John Wick</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It must have been a dream working on this particular film, especially while working with fellow fight choreographers turned directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt; is a raucously perfect film when it S&amp;#39;s TFU and lets the action speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a medium budget film that demonstrates how entertaining a movie can be when the filmmakers truly understand that they&amp;#39;re working in a visual medium. Most of the exposition in this film is non-verbal and respects the audience enough to know we can make simple connections without being beat about the head and face. And when we do get to the actual beating of heads and faces, it&amp;#39;s genuinely clever in its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fight scenes â€“ and there are more than a few â€“ are exuberant and flawlessly executed. What they are not, however, is typical. Keanu, instead of reprising &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;s stiff-legged Kung-Fu style, uses grappling techniques, Jiu-jitsu, and Judo. The fights feel authentic, even a little ragged, all while being perfectly staged. Like great dialogue, the fights are extemporaneous yet exhaustively refined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film itself follows this aesthetic. It has all the usual tropes of the genre, but either manages to cleverly subvert them â€“ mostly by using them as a kind of shorthand to move the plot forward â€“ or simply embraces them with a refreshing lack of irony. I would imagine working with a fully-engaged Keanu Reeves was bit of a treat. While he is often a target of ridicule, it&amp;#39;s clear that the guy comes to work with his lunchbox. I never caught a whiff of the bemused &amp;quot;here I am again&amp;quot; smirk that has fouled Bruce Willis and his peers lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the film occasionally falters is in the quieter moments. It still looks great, but feels a little stitched together when it slows down enough for everyone to catch their breath. Happily, though, such moments are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did a man&amp;#39;s job, Jon. Especially in the set piece in the bar. A sequence that probably should inspire a new category at the Academy Awards: Best Action Sequence For A Directors Reel. This is a calling card moment that rivals anything I&amp;#39;ve seen latelyâ€”including that most holy of holies, &lt;em&gt;The Raid: Redemption&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve watched a lot of film in my forty-odd years, and probably far too much of it has been this type of movie. But that sequence in the bar made me feel young again, and reminded me that I haven&amp;#39;t seen it all. And for that, Jon, I thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Nightcrawler</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What did you think when you first saw Lou Bloom (aka. Jake Gyllenhaal) roaming the surreal Los Angeles landscape that you helped create? Was it worth all those lonely nights, the bad food, the lost sleep?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I certainly think it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must have been a gruelling 28 nights of isolated, thankless work; even though it was punctuated by the excitement of shooting a couple of elaborate car chases and a set piece that is a masterwork of suspense.That kind of compressed schedule means no one sleeps, everyone is on edge, and there&amp;#39;s zero room for mistakes. Yet you and your unit managed to deliver a seamless piece of visual art, made all the more effective by Gyllenhaal&amp;#39;s Oscar-bait performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel for you, Mike. I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve tripped over a few creatures like Lou during in your time in the business. The kind of relentless opportunist â€“ in this case a predatory loner who falls into the murky waters of local TV crime reporting â€“ whose every action is purely transactional, whose each waking second is dedicated to an emotional calculus in search of leverage. Fortunately, though, one of the few perks of the second unit is that you&amp;#39;re largely clear of the studio suits. Your work is judged almost exclusively on how well it melds with the aesthetic of the director (in this case first-timer Dan Gilroy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler&lt;/em&gt;, that aesthetic isn&amp;#39;t the time-stamped Los Angeles of &lt;em&gt;Chinatown&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;LA Confidential&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s the murky, off-brand L.A. of Michael Mann or Nicolas Winding Refn&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt;. Remote, nameless streets and underpasses. Endless stretches of highway going from nowhere to nowhere. A never-ending ghost town dotted with marginal lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and the first unit worked in perfect concert to capture and sustain that mood. Even the interior scenes were desolate. The term &amp;quot;skeleton crew&amp;quot; was never more apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you feel a slight kinship to Lou&amp;#39;s shadow existence, beginning your work when most other people disappear into sleep? Did he fascinate you the way he fascinated meâ€”like watching a shark circle a wounded fish? Admirably, Gyllenhaal never allows Lou Bloom to betray the purity of your vision of L.A. He lives in perpetual half-light, never exposing himself, except when it&amp;#39;s time for him to feed, literally, at the trough of misery (whether accidentally or intentionally). He has the inevitability of a vulture in the desert, the moral compass of a starving hyena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are probably functional parallels between your work and the service Lou provides. You both are independent and free of direct supervision, a separate but essential piece of a larger effort. Both of you live and work in the opposite direction of most human&amp;#39;s circadian rhythms and see very few people other than those that choose, or are forced, to live that existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other parallel came to mind as I watched this film. If cinema is â€“ and I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll agree with me here, Mike â€“ a continuing conversation, then Gyllenhaal&amp;#39;s Lou Bloom is flawlessly described in this quote from another, equally vivid film about an organism attuned to its environment: &amp;quot;â€¦a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To all the Nightcrawlers,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you, who at the end of our screening of &lt;em&gt;Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance&lt;/em&gt; actually said, and I quote, &amp;quot;Well, I liked itâ€¦&amp;quot; (at this point you actually paused for effect) &amp;quot;â€¦but I didn&amp;#39;t love it.&amp;quot; I could almost hear the snap from the air-quotes bracketing the word &amp;#39;love&amp;#39;. I repressed my indignant fist clench long enough to make sure you were not being waggishâ€”because that would have actually been pretty funny. But nope, you were just being ignorant, without any of the unexpected virtue.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to make very clear why I feel the way I do, even though I&amp;#39;m sure you are already constructing your pithy response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu is the kind of director that even when I&amp;#39;m not completely taken with a particular film (I&amp;#39;m looking at you, &lt;em&gt;Babel&lt;/em&gt;), I love that he exists. As with Michael Gondry, Von Trier, Alexander Payne, Kathryn Bigelow, and now Bennett Miller, these are men and women for who film is a place where you try and scrape at little bits of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some filmmakers for who the creative process is more akin to a demonstration of a truth, the late Stanley Kubrick and David Fincher come to mind, but IÃ±Ã¡rritu and his peers seem to be searching for something less definitive with the films they make. And I&amp;#39;m pretty sure even they aren&amp;#39;t certain if they are going to find it at the end of one hundred and twenty minutes. To dedicate the time and energy necessary to produce &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; feature film when you are not at all clear if it will work, much less make any sense, takes some huge cojones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film could have been a spectacular &lt;em&gt;Nymphomania&lt;/em&gt;-type disaster were it not so fundamentally well executed. It was that ambitious. The number of opportunities for missteps, the huge risks - both in performance as well as intention and structure - were countless. But it all worked, beautifully, elegantly. It has been a long time since I left a theatre feeling so sure of the value of film; of the possibilities of creating something other than a competent entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you and your banal commentary took a huge dump all over my exuberance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that cynical disregard for the actual content of a particular work was one of the themes of &lt;em&gt;Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance&lt;/em&gt;. Even the naysayers, the parasitic creatures that swim around the edges of any creative endeavor looking to bathe in some of the reflected light, had their moment. Did you feel an echo in your withered soul when IÃ±Ã¡rritu uses Keaton&amp;#39;s character as a surrogate to vent his rage against a particularly vile type of theatre critic? Or did that go over your head too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot will be written about the parallels between the actors and the characters they play; Naomi Watts as the successful but pathologically insecure actress, Keaton&amp;#39;s character is a hive of meta-references to both his and IÃ±Ã¡rritu&amp;#39;s careers, Edward Norton as the brilliant but irredeemably disruptive talent. There is also the feigned single take that takes place over a series of weeks, which was both useful and technically brilliant. But that is all window dressing. What drives the film is the notion that sometimes vain, petty, venal men and women manage to craft some art. Somehow these very characteristics are as essential to creation as dedication, discipline and talent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m guessing this probably passed you by while you were busy crafting bon mots about the ludicrousness of Ed Norton&amp;#39;s prosthetic junk. Because it is not to enough to be petty, venal and vain unless you actually have something to bring to the dance. Otherwise you are just fodder for other people&amp;#39;s creative expression.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The One I Love</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Of all forms of art, painting still feels to me like the most romantic and sophisticated. Maybe it&amp;#39;s ignorance, or just plain envy, but I still marvel when someone can create a new world simply with a mixing of color and a flick of the wrist. Based on &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt;, I think director Charlie McDowell feels the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shouldn&amp;#39;t feel that way. McDowell&amp;#39;s first feature film is a real doozy, and a filmmaking tutorial on how to leverage a smart script, with limited locations and actors, into something much grander than his tiny canvas should allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear, from the evocative poster design to an emotional expression by co-star Mark Duplass, that he&amp;#39;s using painting as shorthand for enlightenment throughout the film. Or at least that&amp;#39;s how Elizabeth Moss, who plays Duplass&amp;#39;s wife, interprets his dabbling in the fine art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, a man who paints must be a sensitive soul, right? Or is that just a projection? And if a woman appreciates the arts, does that threaten a man who lacks those same skills?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions in this film go much further than that, of course. Should we work to improve ourselves, or change our expectations of others? At what point are we each still trying to realize our potential versus living in a fantasy? How do we see ourselves, and how do others see us? And what would happen if those two scenarios were somehow drawn together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only teasing the outline of the film itself, but I feel that&amp;#39;s appropriate. You and I both know what the real picture looks like, Jeremy. But there are so many fun and unexpected turns in this dissection of a marriage that it would be a shame to reveal too much ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/9/gone-girl.html&quot;&gt;sounds familiar&lt;/a&gt;, I know). Yet what makes &lt;em&gt;The One I Love&lt;/em&gt; so appealing is that it&amp;#39;s not just a shaded portrait of a relationship, but a tangled and interpretive piece that begs to be examined from multiple angles. A sort of filmic M.C. Escher drawing. Within the first 20 minutes, when the couple goes on a retreat at the behest of their therapist, the film transforms into something that&amp;#39;s much higher-concept and richer in theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people will no doubt take issues with the lack of clarity. McDowell has chosen to paint his world in the abstract. But I would argue that this choice is to the film&amp;#39;s credit. The larger metaphor being explored is so strong that it doesn&amp;#39;t require more information. I was happy dissecting pure emotion to discover the film&amp;#39;s truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the sign of a great piece of artâ€”painted or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Province of Television</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Television,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at you, all grown up. Nudity, foul language, and Steve Buscemi. I hardly recognize you anymore. Of course, much of that has to do with the fact that you&amp;#39;re no longer exactly what people used to call television. Sometimes elective surgery &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a good thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the nicest thing you could have said about yourself was that you were free. Ironically, it was not until people started paying for you, one way or another, that you became something other than a delivery system for commercials every twelve minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid to late 80s, with the advent of Beta and VHS cassettes, miniseries&amp;#39; began to be marketed as complete works, sans commercials. They found their way into video stores and people&amp;#39;s homesâ€”usually event programming like &lt;em&gt;Shogun&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rich Man, Poor Man.&lt;/em&gt; All of a sudden television wasn&amp;#39;t just what was being broadcast at any particular hour. People could choose when and how they watched their programs. Incidentally, this new marketing strategy also showed creative types what possibilities might exist for long form television, stripped of the structural constraints that were, until then, endemic to your form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupled with the meteoric improvement in base technology (you used to have screens not much larger than an iPad) as well as production quality, what was being broadcast into people&amp;#39;s homes came more and more to mimic the gold standard. HBO and it&amp;#39;s imitators began to make shows that not only eschewed the usual rigid structural constraints of network television, but began to introduce content that you would have blushed at in your Mary-Ann and Ginger days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, you came more and more to resemble the very thing that had held you at arm&amp;#39;s length for decades: cinema. Until that moment, your only point of contact with your older, more sophisticated sibling had been &lt;em&gt;Love Boat&lt;/em&gt; guest shots for faded stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinema and its adherents had long held you in contemptâ€”like a child everyone wished had stayed hidden in the basement, eating fish heads. But that all changed once emerging specialty channels began to demonstrate the valuable demographics they were able to pullâ€”and what kind of creative freedom those markets promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinctions between the two forms â€“ cinema and whatever you are becoming â€“ are now breaking down so quickly that we will probably have to come up with a new word. &lt;em&gt;Cinevision&lt;/em&gt;, or something similarly trite. But the transition is not complete yet, and the distinctions are not simply technical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way that you can easily watch a film at home without losing much of the experience, technically or atmospherically, I have also been to more than a few &lt;em&gt;Dr. Who&lt;/em&gt; cinema experiences. National Geographic also plays regularly on IMAX screens, and it&amp;#39;s not strange at all to see something that straddles both medias, like Joss Whedon&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Firefly/Serenity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, though, is the soul of wit. Concision is not your strong suit. Not yet, anyways. The very thing that you offer as your greatest gift: the richness and possibilities of long form story telling, is the quality that limits you most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/em&gt; would flail as anything other than a tight 114 minutes. &lt;em&gt;Birdman&lt;/em&gt; can only exist at 119 minutesâ€”not a minute more. Some creations are not meant to live long lives. Just fierce, brief ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as the technical aspects have equalized, and as much as we&amp;#39;re seeing the same actors and directors, these two forms â€“ film and television â€“ are still as disparate as books and music, theater and sculpture. It&amp;#39;s not that you cannot successfully adapt something as profoundly well-executed as &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt;, or competently rework the curiously epicurean world of &lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s just that in doing so you change them fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feeling you get at the conclusion of &lt;em&gt;Deadwood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hour&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to stepping out of an experience like &lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;, is a subtle one, but â€“ for me, anyways â€“ profound. &lt;em&gt;Amelie&lt;/em&gt;, and more recently Michael Haneke&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt;, are also superb examples of stories that would collapse under their own weight if they were stretched out to accommodate the scope of a miniseries. You could produce something with similar themes, even with the same participants, that may well be outstanding. But it will never duplicate the intensity and impact of those two hours in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;m glad you look the way you do. Just yesterday I witnessed an excellent example of what you do so well: a Welsh/BBC series called &lt;em&gt;Hinterland&lt;/em&gt;. Great writing, interesting visuals, competent performances. The strange thing was that the very first episode was ninety minutes long, self-contained, and gave no previous context for the world or characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t bite in quite the same way. There was a restraint inherent in the storytelling, a tendency to bow to the one expediency television can never escape: that there is always a next episode.&lt;/p&gt;
