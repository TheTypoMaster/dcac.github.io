We critics love to lament the difficulty and futility of reducing film criticism to a series of lists. Readers, on the other hand, go crazy over these year-end cheat sheets. So while the editorial staff of Dear Cast and Crew couldn't settle on any definitive best-of list to cap off the year (other than our illustrious [Silver Stamps][1]), the concession prize is that I offer you my own person short list for the year's best films.

Now here's the final caveat - a year-end bout of pneumonia prohbited me from seeing a handful of December releases that have earned much praise over the holidays. I've listed those titles below. But suffice to say, 2013 was an amazing year for cinema and I'm extremely happy with my recommendations as they stand.

_Special mentions_: The incredible [_Stories We Tell_][21] was actually a 2012 release in Canada (but 2013 for U.S.), so I'm not including it. Same with [_Blackbird_][22], though it's also fantastic.

Finally, my **Notably Unseen of 2013** are _Inside Llewyn Davis_, _Her_, _The Wolf of Wall Street_, _The Past_, _The Great Beauty_ and _Nebraska._ There are undoubtedly others. If there's something you think I missed, let me know!
