It is interesting, and a little alarming, that so many sophomore directors are being handed projects that have potentially studio-destroying budgets. Marc Webb with the Garfield _Spider-man_, Colin Treverrow with _Jurassic World_, Josh Trank with _Fantastic Four_ and, until recently, an iteration of the _Star Wars_ franchise. Last year it was Gareth Edwards with _Godzilla_, this year it is Jon Watts and the Spiderman reboot—Watts is, incidentally, a director who’s first feature _hasn’t actually been in wide release yet_. 

I am not particularly opposed to first time directors getting relatively high profile gigs. Directing seems to be one of those professions that, more often than not, is only perfected through doing. What doesn’t make a lot of sense to me is the immediate jump from zero funded indie to making films with budgets that are the GNP’s of some countries. 

When even someone as savvy and experienced as Joss Whedon (although _The Avengers_ really was just his second film) can be turned out because of the kind of terrible shearing pressure that these films can generate, it seems a awful lot to expect first-or-second timers to negotiate. In fact Josh Trank, who’s indie _Chronicle_ (12 million dollar budget) led directly to _The Fantastic Four_ (budget 122 million) lost the _Star Wars_ gig at least partially because of erratic behavior on the set of _FF._  And while ‘erratic behavior’ is hardly something new in Hollywood it seems a legitimate question to ask how much of that behavior is the direct result of the exponential increase in pressure that follows along in the wake of this kind of movie.

If it were only a question of money or even logistics perhaps a lack of practical experience would be less of an issue. But the pressures involved doing this kind of film come literally from every angle imaginable. It is hard to conceive of anyone without a fair amount of real experience, both as a director and just as a human, not being pulled apart. 

(For an absolutely object example of how badly this can actually go I would point everyone to the documentary _Overnight._ Troy Duffy was the writer/director of _Boondock Saints_ and is the poster boy for the worst-case scenario in this instance.)

These budgets not only represent a huge investment on the part of the studio but they also come with any number of peripheral expectations. To serve the fan base, to meet unrealistic first weekend goals, to manage the kind of pressures that come with promotional budgets that are almost as large as the production budgets. Sometimes these films even represent investments large enough to topple whole studio—forget what a flop might do to the individuals involved. There are probably very few twenty-six year olds equipped to manage any one of these concerns, much less all of them.

I could care less, frankly, whether or not any particular film works or not. My concern is what we are doing to a whole generation of up and coming filmmakers. Not so long ago it was possible to build a body of work that allowed for a gradual maturing of the creative process. Directors like Scorsese, Cuarón, The Coen Bros.. Kathryn Bigelow or even Guillermo Del Toro were initially involved in low budget, low stakes (at least in a fiscal sense) filmmaking. Films like _Mean Streets, _Near Dark_, _Sólo Con Tu Pareja, El Espinazo del Diablo_, _Blood Simple_, were, most importantly, all steps along a longer creative path and not just an audition for a place at the summer tentpole trough.

What that meant was the filmmakers in question could afford a mistake or two and it wouldn’t cost the studio millions of dollars, people their careers or even risk ending up being the punch line in a terrible joke. Q: What cost 200 million dollars and has four arms. A: _John Carter of Mars._And let’s face it, you don’t hear Andrew Stanton being bandied about as someone who is the next big thing—but this was a guy, just three years ago, who was being touted asanother Brad Bird.

Probably the best example I can give of the potential cost of all this is not the most obvious one. If you compare _Jurassic World_ to _Mad Max: Fury Road_ you might say one was a moderate success while the other was an unprecedented accomplishment. But if you watch all the interviews and the various and sundry media that led up to both releases, only one of these directors looked like they had just finished crossing the ocean in an open boat while fighting off sharks the whole way. And it wasn’t the seventy year old who had spent six months in the desert with a pissed off Tom Hardy.

Colin Treverrow looks and sounds like he has a bad case of PTSD and implicit in almost all his interviews is a kind of weariness that seems almost tragic. This is person whose first film, _Safety Not Guaranteed,_ was a charming, low budget indie. His next film is _Jurassic World_, literally one of the highest grossing films ever made. Oddly enough, as I was writing this paragraph I came across this quote, from Treverrow, in an article from Indiewire on July 7th  2015, “[Spielberg] had the privilege of being able to make a long series of original films—‘Sugarland Express,’ ‘Duel,’ and then ‘Jaws’—and from there, built up to something the size of [the ‘Jurassic Park’ franchise]. And in a certain way, I felt like I was being robbed of that right of a filmmaker to make a bunch of mistakes and learn from those mistakes.”

Clearly this isn’t simply a question of right or wrong. Of course most directors will jump at the chance to lead one of these films. People who choose that particular profession are not generally familiar with the meaning of the term hubris (although notably Ava DuVernay has turned down Black Panther—so it is not always the case). Certainly it is ridiculous to expect the studios not to continue along this path as long as the success rate is over a certain percentage.

Perhaps the question is what is the cost of our seeming never ending desire for more and bigger and faster. There is a huge amount of social media pressure being exerted to produce whole slews of the kind of shared world films that the Marvel and DC universes represent. Perhaps in our collective desire to see these films created we have lost sight of some of the costs involved. 

It is worth wondering, at least, what these individuals might have done were they not so quickly subsumed into the machine, if they had to eke out their own path in the wilderness for a little while longer. 

After all, can you really have a _Mad Max: Fury Road_ without first having taken the long trip Beyond Thunderdome? 

I tend to doubt it.
