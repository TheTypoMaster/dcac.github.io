It is interesting, and a little alarming, that so many sophomore directors are being handed projects  potentially studio-destroying budgets. Marc Webb with the Garfield _Spiderman_, Colin Treverrow with _Jurassic World_, Josh Trank with _Fantastic Four_ and,until recently, an iteration of the _Star Wars franchise. Last year it was Gareth Edwards with [_Godzilla_](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/5/16/godzilla.html), this year it is Jon Watts and the Spiderman reboot—Watts is, incidentally, a director who first feature _hasn’t actually been in wide release_ yet. 

I am not particularly opposed to first time directors getting relatively high profile gigs. Directing seems to be one of those professions that, more often than not, is only perfected through doing. What doesn’t make a lot of sense to me is the immediate jump from zero funded indie to making films with budgets that are the GNP’s of some countries. 

When even someone as savvy and experienced as Joss Whedon (although _[The Avengers](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/5/11/the-avengers.html)_ really was just his second film) can be turned out because of the kind of terrible shearing pressure that these films can generate, it seems a awful lot to expect first-or-second timers to negotiate. Josh Trank, who indie _Chronicle_ (12 million dollar budget) led directly to _The Fantastic Four_ (budget 122 million) lost the _Star Wars_ gig at least partially because of erratic behavior on the set of _FF._  And while erratic behavior is hardly something new in Hollywood it seems a legitimate question to ask how much of that behavior is the direct result of the exponential increase in pressure that follows along in the wake of this kind of movie

If it were only a question of money or even logistics perhaps a lack of practical experience would be less of an issue. But the pressures involved doing this kind of film come literally from every angle imaginable. It is hard to conceive of anyone without a fair amount of experience, both as a director and just as a human, not being pulled apart



These budgets not only represent a huge investment on the part of the studio but they also come with any number of peripheral expectation to serve the fan base, to meet unrealistic first weekend goals, to manage the kind of pressures that come with promotional budgets that are almost as large as the production budgets. Sometimes these films even represent investments large enough to topple whole studio—forget what a flop might do to the individuals involved. There are probably very few twenty-six year olds equipped to manage any one of these concerns, much less all of them.

I could care less whether or not a particular film works. My concern is what we are doing to a whole generation of up and coming filmmakers. Not so long ago it was possible to build a body of work that allowed for a gradual maturing of the creative process. Directors like Scorsese, Cuarón, The Coen Bros. Kathryn Bigelow or even Guillermo Del Toro were initially involved in low budget, low stakes (at least in a fiscal sense) filmmaking. Films like _Mean Streets_, _Near Dark_, _Sólo Con Tu Pareja_, _El Espinazo del Diablo_, _Blood Simple,_ were, most importantly, all steps along a longer creative path and not just an audition for a place at the summer tentpole trough.

What that meant was the filmmakers in question could afford a mistake or two and it wouldn’t cost the studio millions of dollars, people their careers or even risk ending up being the punch line in a terrible joke. Q: What cost 200 million dollars and has four arms. A: _John Carter._  don’t hear Andrew Stanton being bandied about as the next big thing—but this was a guy, just three years ago, who was being touted as another Brad Bird.

Probably the best example I can give of the potential cost of all this is not the most obvious one. If you compare _[Jurassic World](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/6/12/jurassic-world.html)_ to _[Mad Max: Fury Road](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/5/20/mad-max-fury-road.html)_ you might say one was a moderate success while the other was an unprecedented accomplishment. But if you watch all the interviews media that led up to both releases, only one of directors looked like they had just finished crossing the ocean in an open boat while fighting off sharks the whole way. And it wasn’t the seventy yearold who had spent six months in the desert with a pissed off Tom Hardy.

Colin Treverrow looks and sounds like he has a bad case of PTSD and implicit in almost all his interviews is a kind of weariness that seems almost tragic. This is person whose first film, _[Safety Not Guaranteed](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/3/13/safety-not-guaranteed.html)_, was a charming, low budget indie. His next film _Jurassic World_,  one of the highest grossing films ever made. Treverrow in an article from Indiewire on July 7th  2015 “[Spielberg] had the privilege of being able to make a long series of original films—_Sugarland Express_,  _Duel_, and then _Jaws_—and from there, built up to something the size of [the _Jurassic Park_ franchise]. And in a certain way, I felt like I was being robbed of that right of a filmmaker to make a bunch of mistakes and learn from those mistakes.”

 isn’t simply a question of right or wrong. Of course most directors will jump at the chance to one of these films. People who choose that particular profession are not generally familiar with the meaning of the term hubris (although notably Ava DuVernay has turned down _Black Panther_—so it is not always the case). Certainly it is ridiculous to expect the studios not to continue along this path as long as the success rate is over a certain percentage.

Perhaps the question is what is the cost of our seeming never ending desire for more and bigger and faster There is a huge amount of social media pressure being exerted to produce slews of the kind of shared world films that the Marvel and DC universes represent. Perhaps in our collective desire to see these films created we have lost sight of some of the costs involved. 

It is worth wondering, at least, what these individuals might have done were they not so quickly subsumed into the machine, if they had to eke out their own path in the wilderness for a little while longer. 

After all, can you really have a _Mad Max: Fury Road_ without first having taken the long trip Beyond Thunderdome? 

I tend to doubt it.
