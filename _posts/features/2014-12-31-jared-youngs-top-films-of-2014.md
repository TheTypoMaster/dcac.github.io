Yes, it’s true. Our attempts to compile a comprehensive, democratic list of Dear Cast and Crew’s favorite films of 2014 was scrapped after an epic email thread replete with name-calling and threats of physical harm. 

Which is to be expected. The disagreements between our staff of writers has expressed itself in all [sorts](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/4/13/the-cabin-in-the-woods-1.html) [of](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/4/13/the-cabin-in-the-woods-2.html) [wonderfully](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/5/16/star-trek-into-darkness.html) [passive](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/6/6/out-of-darkness-revisiting-the-wrath-of-khan.html) [aggressive](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/11/9/skyfall.html) [ways](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/11/17/five-reasons-skyfall-fell-flat.html) [over](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/21/summer-of-2014.html)[the years](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/9/2/summer-of-2014-the-revisitation.html). 

But in the spirit of healthy rhetorical debate (and petty one-upsmanship), here is an alternative to [C. Redmond’s Top Films of 2014] (http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/31/c-redmonds-top-films-of-2014.html). While I haven’t seen quite as many films this year, the ones that resonated represent a broad range of genres, budgets, and artistic ambitions. From an indie thriller that channels early John Carpenter, to a blockbuster animated flick adapted from a building toy, the year’s best flicks were as diverse (and satisfying) as any in recent memory.

(But let’s be honest. Christopher and I agree on a lot of these films. Ultimately, this alternate list is just an excuse to lavish more praise on [The Trip to Italy](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/1/the-trip-to-italy.html), which was the catalyst of the aforementioned slander and abuse).
