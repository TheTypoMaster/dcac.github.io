This is what I come here to see.

*Force Majeure* made waves at Cannes, and deserves a much bigger audience than the Swedish family drama will probably find. Tense and hilarious, Ruben Ã–stlund has crafted a damn-near perfect exploration of modern masculinity and heterosexual relationships. The film is laser-focused on the very filmic principle that action reveals character, and entertainingly explores how a single instinct can overpower our entire understanding of a another human being. If only the film had stuck to its guns and ended one scene earlier to maintain the principle indictment, I would have fallen for the film whole-heatedly.
