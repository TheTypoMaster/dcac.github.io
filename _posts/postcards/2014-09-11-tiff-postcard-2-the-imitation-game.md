This is The Important British film with a capital WWII that everyone at the festival has been waiting for. And wow, it delivers.

The story of mathematician/code-cracking genius Alan Turing was Oscar-bait the moment it was conceived as a screenplay. But what's amazing is how well everything is actually handled. The non-chronological structure helps to not only keep the pacing strong, the plot twists engaging, and the character turns more dynamic, but also ensures that the climax is properly chilling without a sagging denouement. It's an exceptional story told exceptionally well.

The cast is also in fine form, even if _Sherlock's_ Benedict Cumberbatch was the too-obvious choice to play another brilliant, socially awkward techno wiz. Consider it his redemption for [another similar role](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/10/22/the-fifth-estate.html) in a film that opened your fest last year. This time, he's given real heart and a full character arc, which finds a great dramatic ally in the film's already monumental historical stakes.

If enough people see the film, it's easily the most obvious (and maybe appropriate) choice for winning this year's famous Audience Award.
