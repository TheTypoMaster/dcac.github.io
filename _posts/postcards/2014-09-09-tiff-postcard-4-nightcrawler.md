That first clap you heard when the screening was over? That was me. And the sigh of relief right afterwards? That was me, too. I was waiting to find the film at this year's festival that I'd flip over, and I finally did.

Fearless and fascinating characters, a gripping plot, biting satire, a wicked sense of humor—*Nightcrawler* almost feels like this year's *Spring Breakers* ( [high praise, indeed](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/3/28/spring-breakers.html)).

From the opening scene, Dan Gilroy, in his directorial debut, makes a statement that anything can and will happen. Jake Gyllenhaal takes his creepiness to just the right places in this film about a man who's looking for a job – any job, really – that will suit his yet-to-be-defined skills and bald-faced ambition. Needless to say, he finds something he's rather perfect for. My spoiler-phobic instincts allowed me to experience every moment with complete surprise, and I was swept away by the excitement. Now I'm turning all my enthusiasm into word-of-mouth buzz, so people can hopefully avoid the terribly revealing trailer for a film that goes way-too-deep into the third act.

People should just trust me – and you – and check out this film.
