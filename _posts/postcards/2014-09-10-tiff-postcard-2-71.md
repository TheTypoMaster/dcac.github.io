I'm not usually a fan of war movies (don't tell anyone, but still haven't seen_Saving Private Ryan_), but you definitely got my attention with this one.

Set in the early days of The Troubles in Belfast, a rookie British soldier finds himself lost and alone in IRA-controlled territory. I was on the edge of my seat as he dodged through alleyways, attempting to find his way back to his barracks while trying to avoid getting shot by zealots. And I sincerely appreciated how complicated the politics were—and that no one in this battle was wholly innocent (except, maybe, our protagonist).

If more combat films could be like this – tense thrillers that are more about survival than destruction – I might just become a convert.

**Sincerely,**
