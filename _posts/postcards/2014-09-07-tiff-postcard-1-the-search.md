Some things you just want to like.

The Search, Michael Hazanavicius’ follow up to his phenomenally successful *The Artist*, must have had you salivating when you saw it on the calendar.Starring Bérénice Bejo, and Annette Bening, with a tremendous breakout performance by a young man (a child, really), named Maksim Emelyanov, *The Search* has a multi-faceted storyline filled with the kind of war-torn pathos that send chills through the Oscar crowd while still retaining some indie cred.

​I can imagine your disappointment then, when you first screened it. Despite rambling, often stilted performances from the two principal cast members, it has great cinematography and some remarkable visual storytelling that is then undercut by long-winded, hackneyed speechifying (from Bening particularly).

A six dressed up as a nine is somehow more disappointing than just a six.
